HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for
whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachusetts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians
at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his residuary estate
for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts,
farthest outpost of the province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Williamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26, 1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the idea
of creating a college where, as they put it, “young gentlemen from every part of the Union” might resort for instruction “ in all the branches of useful and
polite literature.” The proposal was extremely ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty–first institution of higher learning to flower in onetime British colonies, the second in
Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June 22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.

I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Williams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of
dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trustees and the
legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they
had chosen was stubbornly uncongenial–so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time and energy in trying to close
the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore
took matters into his own hands. Convinced that almost everything about Williams was impossible–its location, its funds, its enrollment–he led a group of
students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As
for Williams, one member of the senior class wrote home to his father: “It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether it shall linger along
for two or three years.”
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essential to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend Edward
Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the College’s reputation for religious conservatism to collect
much–needed funds. By 1828, the Reverend Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a handsome new
building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike many other New England colleges where the classical
curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen, doctors,
lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding communities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a
place to which “young gentlemen from every part of the Union” resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement exercises in 1838,
jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there: “Country graduates–rough, brown–featured, schoolmaster–looking...A
rough hewn, heavy set of fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as farmer–boys.”
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the
small New England liberal arts college. Scenery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way toward
compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, “It would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the base of a mountain.” For
Thoreau the location of Williams was “as good at least as one well–endowed professorship.”
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the
famous episode of the “haystack meeting” in the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversations in
spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby haystack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of
American foreign missions. The extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling stranglehold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future
welfare of the College. Their action gave Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was rewarded
when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trustees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.

II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins, who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and
president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student the
center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S. President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement
in an aphorism which has passed into the lore of American education: “The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other.”
The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College’s great assets. It has been perpetuated in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like
most other colleges Williams did not experience growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country
college; a Massachusetts court decision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that businessmen could profit
from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New England.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark
Hopkins himself observed that he did “not see how the College could have got on” without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890’s Frederick Ferris Thompson of the Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to
supersede the Commonwealth as the largest benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams’ original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by additional gifts
and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.

III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when aspirations toward university status were unsettling
many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curriculum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected course

5

election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student
freedom in course election. A survey of the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and election, the
goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American college without any absolutely required courses and without any
uncontrolled wide–option electives. The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century,
Williams did not need to rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the same influence continues, the competitive pressure for
admission since World War II has allowed for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences of this change
have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an
institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary
worship in the form of ecumenical chapel services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In response to the
concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent
with college purpose, the Trustees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house system. Williams became, as
a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeducational and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have
reinforced the spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate transformations, as a careful comparative study of the
yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to the present 4–1–4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide–ranging schedule and program both on and beyond
the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of
language offerings to include full, four–year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student at the center of the educational
experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each department at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet
weekly with the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By 1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class
had experienced at least one tutorial course either in Williamstown or in the Williams–Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year–long immersion in the life of Oxford University.
This curricular expansion, and another in the first decade of this century, reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the college
community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious diversity of American society and of the world more broadly.
The percentage of students who identified themselves as members of one or more American minority group or were overseas citizens rose to 40 percent, of
faculty to 22 percent.
At the same time, programming and structures were introduced to student residential life and major projects were completed to enhance greatly the
College’s student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for faculty.

MISSION AND PURPOSES
Williams seeks to provide the finest possible liberal arts education by nurturing in students the academic and civic virtues, and their related traits of character. Academic virtues include the capacities to explore widely and deeply, think critically, reason empirically, express clearly, and connect ideas creatively.
Civic virtues include commitment to engage both the broad public realm and community life, and the skills to do so effectively. These virtues, in turn, have
associated traits of character. For example, free inquiry requires open-mindedness, and commitment to community draws on concern for others.
We are committed to our central endeavor of academic excellence in a community of learning that comprises students, faculty, and staff, and draws on the
engagement of alumni and parents. We recruit students from among the most able in the country and abroad and select them for the academic and personal
attributes they can contribute to the educational enterprise, inside and outside the classroom. Our faculty is a highly talented group of teachers, scholars, and
artists committed deeply to the education of our students and to involving them in their efforts to expand human knowledge and understanding through original research, thought, and artistic expression. Dedicated staff enable this teaching and learning to take place at the highest possible level, as do the involvement and support of our extraordinarily loyal parents and alumni.
No one can pretend to more than guess at what students now entering college will be called upon to comprehend in the decades ahead. No training in fixed
techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. The most versatile, the most durable, in
an ultimate sense, the most practical knowledge and intellectual resources that we can offer students are the openness, creativity, flexibility, and power of
education in the liberal arts.
Toward that end we extend a curriculum that offers wide opportunities for learning, ensures close attention of faculty to students but also encourages students to learn independently, and reflects the complexity and diversity of the world. We seek to do this in an atmosphere that nurtures the simple joy of
learning as a lifelong habit and commitment.
We place great emphasis on the learning that takes place in the creation of a functioning community: life in the residence halls, expression through the arts,
debates on political issues, leadership in campus governance, exploration of personal identity, pursuit of spiritual and religious impulses, the challenge of
athletics, and direct engagement with human needs, nearby and far away.
To serve well our students and the world, Williams embraces core values such as welcoming and supporting in the College community people from all
segments of our increasingly diverse society and ensuring that College operations are environmentally sustainable.
From this holistic immersion students learn more than they will ever know. Such is the testimony of countless graduates—that their Williams experience
has equipped them to live fuller, more effective lives. Ultimately, the College’s greatest mark on the world consists of this: the contributions our alumni make
in their professions, their communities, and their personal lives.
Therefore, we ask all our students to understand that an education at Williams should not be regarded as a privilege destined to create further privilege, but
as a privilege that creates opportunities to serve society at large, and imposes the responsibility to do so.
At the same time, being itself privileged by its history and circumstances, Williams understands its own responsibility to contribute by thought and
example to the world of higher education.
The above description arises on its surface from public statements made by Williams presidents and others associated with the College, from which it
borrows, and at a deeper level from the felt experience of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and parents over many decades. It was approved by vote of the
Board of Trustees on April 14, 2007.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be
completed and the minimum grade level to be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and concentrate
in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic standards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major, and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Period. The student takes four courses in each semester and during January
pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
Winter Study Period, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a dramatically different educational experience. The differences are in the nature of the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: faculty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can investigate fields outside their
usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different milieu (as interns, for example, or on
trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers students an opportunity for more independence and initiative in a less formal setting, more
opportunity to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least
19 of those semester courses, pass four Winter Study Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement. A student may not repeat a course for which degree credit has
been awarded.

Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts.

Please note that courses used to fulfill these requirements must be regularly

graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT—designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams, students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the
full range of the curriculum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Languages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and
Mathematics. A full listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each division must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than
two of the courses used to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or at programs under the direction of Williams
College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning
the language, whether verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop the capacity for critical discussion, to increase
awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and
which in turn markedly affect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate these human structures in order that they may
better understand themselves and the social world in which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world
deeply influenced by scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantitative reasoning.

Courses with the following designations receive divisional distribution credit as indicated:

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries distribution credit of that subject. Other Environmental Studies
courses may fulfill distribution requirements as indicated under individual course listings.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn
a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each division, for the year. All tutorial courses in the Williams-Exeter Programme at
Oxford University (WIOX) meet the Williams College ‘W’ designation, except for those in studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences. Courses at the Williams-Mystic Program may also be used toward fulfilling the distribution requirement as appropriate.
2) THE EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE REQUIREMENT—Williams College is committed to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty, and student body
that reflects and explores a diverse, globalized world and the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses designated “(D)” in the College Bulletin are a part of the
College’s Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI); they represent our dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as they interact with, and challenge, each other.
Through such courses, students and faculty also consider the multiple approaches that engage these issues. Rather than simply focus on the study of specific peoples,
cultures, or regions of the world, in the past or present, however, courses fulfilling the requirement actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with diversity. They urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and provide them with the tools to do so. The ultimate aim of the requirement is to lay the
groundwork for a life-long engagement with the diverse cultures, societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of the world.
Courses that comprise the Exploring Diversity Initiative may fall under a variety of categories, including (but not limited to) the following:

1. Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies. These courses focus on the differences and similarities between cultures and societies, and/or on the ways in which cultures,
peoples, and societies have interacted and responded to one another in the past.
2. Empathetic Understanding. These courses explore diverse human feelings, thoughts, and actions by recreating the social, political, cultural, and historical context of a
group in order to imagine why within that context, those beliefs, experiences, and actions of the group emerged.
3. Power and Privilege: These courses link issues of diversity to economic and political power relations, investigating how cultural interaction is influenced by various structures, institutions, or practices that enable, maintain, or mitigate inequality among different groups.
4. Critical Theorization: These courses focus on ways scholars theorize the possibilities of cross-cultural understanding and interaction; they investigate the ways that disciplines and paradigms of knowledge both constitute “difference” and are reconfigured by the study of diversity-related questions.
5. Cultural Immersion: In various ways these courses immerse students in another culture and give them the tools with which to understand that culture from the inside. They
include those foreign language courses that explicitly engage in the self-conscious awareness of cultural and societal differences, traditions, and customs as an integral
aspect of language study.
All students are required to complete ONE course that is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional
distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.
By immersing students in foreign cultures, and often by furthering language acquisition, study abroad programs can offer a robust way to study cultural diversity. Students
wishing to fulfill the EDI requirement via the completion of a study abroad program must submit a petition before departure proposing EDI credit for a particular course on
their program, for particular experiences (such as independent research or a homestay), or for a specific language training program they will undertake while abroad. The
petition will require students to describe how they believe their proposed study abroad experience will meet one or more of the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initiative; it
will be considered by the Director of the Exploring Diversity Initiative working in concert with the Committee on Academic Standing.

3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT is intended to help students become adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to the senior year, all students must pass a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course—those marked with a “(Q).” Students requiring
extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary
evaluation in these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers). Click here for a list of courses
offered in 2013-2014 that meet the requirement.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT—All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of sophomore year, and one by the end of the junior year.
Students will benefit most from the writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers, and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
The goal of the writing-intensive course requirement is to improve student writing proficiency across disciplines. Students in these courses should expect to receive guidance on style, argumentation, and other significant aspects of writing, as well as evaluation and criticism of their writing throughout the semester. This may be achieved
through a variety of approaches: brief assignments spaced over the semester, sequenced assignments leading to a longer final paper, etc. Writing-intensive courses may
also include multiple drafts, conferences, peer review, or class discussions designed to improve writing skills. A course with a single long paper due at the end of the
semester, but with no required or structured means of addressing writing issues, would not be considered writing intensive.
Writing-intensive courses require a minimum of 20 pages of writing and have a maximum enrollment of 19 to allow the instructor to devote appropriate attention to writing
over the course of the semester.
All tutorial courses in the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University (WIOX) meet the Williams College ‘W’ designation, except for those in the studio arts,
mathematics, and the sciences.
Click here for a list of courses offered in 2013-2014 that meet the requirement.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended
period of time, in some important field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year.

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A major may also require an additional course and/or one
Winter Study Project during the junior or senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses in the major field and two semester courses, approved
by a major advisor, in associated fields. In interdepartmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors
ask the student to plan a sequence of elective courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or twosemester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of the detailed structure of each major is found under
the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly offered major may propose to be contract
majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, “Courses of Instruction.” Students
interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean’s Office and with potential faculty advisors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunction with a second major. For further details, click here
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted
permission to use a course from one major to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum number of
courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in
one major may not be used for an Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and maintaining a general level of fitness and well-being; of
developing abilities in carry-over activities; of discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with survival implications, such as swimming.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail to complete the test must pass a basic swim course
given in the Physical Education program during the first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Students must enroll in at least two different activities in
fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participation in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A
maximum of three credits may be attained while participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the physical
education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the
remaining two units must come from the physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other
institutions must spend a minimum of four semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six semesters in
residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students
must be in residence for both semesters of the final year.

10

The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for which a student receives credit while not in residence at
Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on exchange or other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory scores in Advanced Placement tests or International
Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the major
or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and
IB credit, however, may not be used to reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to satisfy the
Distribution Requirement.
Degree Credit Based on A-Level Examination Grades
Upon petition from the student, the Committee on Academic Standing may award two course credits toward the Williams degree for each grade of A or B
received on an A-Level Examination in a liberal arts discipline. These credits may be used to accelerate graduation but may not be used to lower the course
load during a semester in residence.
Normally, the student must have completed at least one full year of study at Williams and have met minimum academic standards before the CAS would
consider the petition. The petition must include certification that all degree requirements, including a major, can be fulfilled if the credit is awarded.
Certificate in Foreign Languages
Certificates are awarded in Arabic, French, German, Russian and Spanish. The certificate confirms a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy
and experience with the language in the context of the student’s college education. Seven or eight courses are required, depending on the language. Please
see the individual programs for details and specific requirements.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with undergraduate professional training in engineering. In
this program, a student studies at Williams for 3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engineering
school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon successful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor
of Arts degree from Williams and a Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a Williams degree, including a major and the distribution
requirements. For students majoring in physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses, who have at least a B average in scientific subjects,
and who have a good record in other subjects will be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing for
this program.
The 3-2 program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics and science courses, so it is necessary to plan course selections at Williams carefully.
The booklet “Choosing First Year Courses” includes a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engineers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, majoring in one of the sciences, and then go directly to a
graduate program in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled “Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study.” Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled “Exchange Programs.”
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students interested in any of the options leading to engineering careers.
Many more details about pre-engineering can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.

Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
Africana Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Justice and Law
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Public Health
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the co-ordinate program courses are directly related to the
major, a student may be allowed to reduce the number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not offer concentrations formally, but do provide students with the opportunity to work in areas that cut across departmental
and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics; History of Science; Materials Science Studies; and Performance Studies. They
are listed in this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject—be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or modernism—to teach intellectual skills
that have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation,
and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis—self-criticism, editing, and revision—with the goal of constant improvement.
Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course
with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are specifically targeted for first-year students.
Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider

Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar’s Office about arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving “learning by doing” outside the classroom, has been a relatively understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, faculty have been challenging students to become engaged more personally in the Williams curriculum through field work, whether in the form of research, sustained work on
special projects or through placement with community organizations. Courses which include experiential learning provide students with opportunities to
encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply academic learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to
use their experiences in those settings to think more critically and deeply about what they are studying. Courses involving experiential education as defined above range from fully integrated off-campus programs such as the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program to courses involving one small field
research project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) varies according to the instructor’s judgment. Click here for a list of
2013-2014 courses involving experiential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested students. Community service, internships, research, and the
Museum Associates Program of the College Museum of Art all provide students the chance to “learn by doing” outside the classroom. Information on each
of these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the Williams College area. Service ranges from tutoring or
building homes with Habitat for Humanity, to working with developing non-profit organizations such as Northern Berkshire Creative Arts. For more
information, go to the Office for Community Engagement homepage on the College website or contact Stewart Burns, Director of the Center for Community Engagement.
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through the Career Center and the Center for Environmental
Studies (CES). Research opportunities are also available through individual departments. More information about each of these opportunities is available
online.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art
history, to learn about the field of museum education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with the public.
The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are accepted every spring. For more information, contact Amerila Wood,
Coordinator of Education Programs.
For more information about experiential education at Williams College, visit the Experiential Education website or contact Paula Consolini, Coordinator of Experiential Education (597-4588).
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination, initiative, and intellectual independence within the
major. The Honors Program requires two or three courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specialization
within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for honors in either or
both of the majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors course in the other. Some programs also award honors for their
concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study for honors in the “Courses of Instruction” section.
Students should consult with their departments on their honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required course
units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors candidacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors
at the end of the senior year if, in the judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of the College, arrangements may be made to undertake
courses of independent study under faculty supervision. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registration.
Study Away from Williams
Many students decide to study at another college or university, in this country or abroad, during their undergraduate education. The College encourages
students to think about the option of study away as they begin the process of considering major fields and course requirements during the sophomore year.
All students in good standing with no deficiencies, including financial aid recipients, may study away on approved programs during all or part of the
junior year. Academic credit is earned after evidence of the satisfactory completion of the program. A student wishing to enroll in another institution or
program in this country or abroad, and to transfer credits earned on this program to Williams, must consult with Dean Laura McKeon and the appropriate
department chair early in the fall semester of the sophomore year. Students are responsible for reading the Guide to Study Abroad available in the Dean’s
Office. They should also consult faculty members with expertise in the area or region of interest to them. All students who are curious about the off-campus
study option should browse through the reference library in the Dean’s Office and attend one of the general information meetings that Dean McKeon offers
throughout the autumn and in February. After attending an information session, students are free to schedule an appointment with the Dean. Approval is
required from the chair of the student’s major department, Dean McKeon, and the Committee on Academic Standing. Students wishing to study away for
any portion of the junior year must request approval in March of the sophomore year by submitting a petition to the Dean’sOffice including a supporting
essay.
When a student decides to accept an offer of admission from a program, he or she must notify the Dean’s Office. The Committee on Academic Standing
will grant formal approval after that with a letter specifying how many credits a student must earn to equal a semester or year of credit at Williams. Students
need to attend a pre-departure meeting and meet all the guidelines as directed in the Guide to Study Abroad. Upon return to Williams, students must complete a program evaluation in order to receive credit.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; they are usually given enrollment preference for such
courses, though interested juniors and seniors are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for juniors and seniors (and, often,
for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.

12

Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses—or even small seminars—on student participation. They aim to teach students how to
develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogently to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous
conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a description of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students. At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar, and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly
group meetings of all tutorial members to provide background information designed to facilitate the students’ independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a
report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to the assignment for that week, while the other student—and then the instructor—offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six
critiques of their partners’ work.
Since the program’s inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding—and rewarding—courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the same time, students have consistently placed
tutorials among the most enriching and consequential courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended implications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as
they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have
formed important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teachers.
Registration information: Students pre–register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but should first check the description for prerequisites
and to see if permission of the instructor is required). Because of limited enrollments and the special logistical arrangements involved in organizing tutorials, students may not drop a tutorial after 4:00 PM on the day before the first scheduled day of organizational meetings each semester. It is therefore
important that students determine, before the start of the term, their interest in and commitment to the course. If they are uncertain whether they wish to
take the tutorial, they should consult with the instructor. Tutorials may not be taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Click here for a list of tutorials offered in 2013-2014. Students may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the
course descriptions and the instructors. (All tutorials have a “T” after the course number.) For general information, advice, or suggestions about the program, please contact Associate Professor Bernard Rhie, Tutorial Program Director for 2013-2014, in Hollander 110.
Williams-EPRI-UCT-Interstudy Cape Town Policy in Action Program
Williams offers a unique fall semester program of studies in Cape Town, South Africa in partnership with the Economic Policy Research Institute,
Interstudy and the University of Cape Town. This innovative experiential study away program teaches students about South African politics, society and
development. Students take courses at the University of Cape Town and the Economic Policy Research Institute where they also hone their research skills
through a policy fieldwork placement. The program’s unique feature is the unifying seminar/tutorial on contemporary social and political issues in South
Africa. This course partners Williams students with South African Parliamentarians in a collaborative learning effort focused on policy issues of mutual
interest. Interested students should consult the Dean’s Office or www.williams.edu/go/africa for more information.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House,
Williams’ study center at Oxford, the Programme is designed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of
one of the world’s great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calendar is followed.
Interested students should consult the Dean’s Office. Click here for a more complete description of the programme.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic, Pacific and
Gulf Coasts, and to undertake original research of their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester’s
credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary
curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either
Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Williams College faculty members serve as the Director
and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Louisiana
seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the
world’s largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped laboratory, and diverse
coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and
estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the
sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling
academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors are welcome—a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14
different majors spanning the sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Williams-Mystic
at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), or visit the website (www.williams.edu/williamsmystic). Williams College students may
study away for full year and also attend the Williams-Mystic program for a semester in the sophomore, junior or senior year.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does not administer a general system of required classroom
attendance. The College expects students to make full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks incurred by
absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such standards of attendance as they deem necessary for the
satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued absence
could result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any regularly graded course dropped after the designated course change period.
Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is required
at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor or the Dean’s Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of
activities approved by the Department of Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.

Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day
late fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced deadlines, including the subject designation for cross-listed courses.
New students register online in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their assigned Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their
course selections. All course changes for new students are made after these meetings. During the first two years of study, students are limited in the number of courses
they may take in one department or subject each semester as follows:
a) First-year students may take no more than one course with the same course prefix, nor more than two in one department, in a semester.
b) Sophomores may take no more than two courses with the same course prefix, nor more than three in one department, in a semester.
c) Sophomores may take no more than three courses with the same course prefix, nor more than four in one department, during the full year.
d) A student may take no more than a total of five courses with the same course prefix, nor more than eight in one department, during the first two years.
e) Any exception to the above early concentration rule may be requested by a petition (goldenrod) to the Committee on Academic Standing (C.A.S.) filed at the time of
registration.

Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course changes may be made after that period except with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing, after consultation with the Dean’s Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be added if the
instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A late fee of $5 per day may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced
deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week
of the semester. Upperclass students also may withdraw from a course under the same conditions once in subsequent years. A withdrawal, recorded on the transcript
as a “W,” is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite
conscientious effort to do the work, continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student. The deficiency thereby
incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See “Deficiencies,” page 13 of this document.

Course Load
Students are required to complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with
departmental approval at the time of registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the fall and five in the
spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory
Committee for permission to pursue a reduced course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation that addresses the student’s inability to
maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load. Upon consideration of a student’s petition and supporting documentation, the
Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Committee makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing, which renders decisions. Such cases are
considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during the student’s tenure at Williams.

Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified
as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded basis. A form for
designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar’s Office. A processing fee of $5 per day may be assessed for fifth course grading option designations
accepted after the announced deadline. A course graded “Pass” may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to complete the degree, to fulfill
distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or
major requirements or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation of the student’s cumulative grade-point
average.

The Gaudino Option
♦ This initiative attempts to encourage students to engage in courses of interest beyond their area of focus or “expertise”–dare yourself to enroll in
challenging but intriguing courses that you would otherwise not take!
♦ You can declare a G–option at the beginning of the semester for courses taken at Williams, starting as early as the spring semester of your first year
and as late as the fall semester of your senior year. You can sign up for at most one G–option course per semester, and at most two in your undergraduate career.
♦ You cannot invoke the G–option on a course used to satisfy divisional or other college requirements (EDI, Q, W).
♦ You cannot invoke the G–option for any course that fulfills major or concentration requirements unless it is the very first course you take in that major
or concentration.
♦ You will have up to 30 days after grades are posted to elect to invoke the G–option for a course from the previous semester. If your course grade is
above a certain floor and the instructor of the course approves, then the course grade will be changed to G on your transcript and the GPA will not be
affected by the original grade. The course will count toward graduation, but the transcript will reflect that you declared the course to be an intellectual
stretch.
♦ Any course can be taken with the G–option unless the course description in the College Bulletin explicitly states otherwise.
Declaring the G–option
♦ You can declare a regular course at Williams as one of your two G–options any time during the drop/add period of any semester for which you are
eligible to declare one. You cannot un–declare the G–option after the end of drop/add!
Invoking the G–option
♦ You may ask the Registrar’s Office to invoke your option for a G–option course within 30 days after grades are posted. After 30 days you will keep the
grade you earned in that class if you don’t notify the Registrar that you wish to invoke the G–option. To apply the option, your course grade has to be

14

no lower than the lesser of: (a) your current GPA minus 0.67; or (b) the grade of B–. In addition, the registrar will ask the instructor of the course to
assert that you were “intellectually present.” If either of these conditions is not met, then the grade you earned cannot be removed. “Intellectual
presence” implies that you have attended and participated in all the class meetings and that you have done all the required work. Some instructors
might have other requirements. You should feel free to meet with and interact with your instructor to get the most out of the experience.
♦ Year–long courses are a special case. If a student elects to declare a hyphenated course then s/he has three options once the student completes the
*second* of the two courses:
(a) take no action (and thus the two grades stay on the transcript);
(b) invoke the option for the first of the two courses but not the second (ie, only the second grade stays... thinking: I was uncomfortable at first, but
then I conquered the discomfort);
(c) invoke the option for *both* courses (both grades go away).
Note that a student cannot keep the first course grade and G–option the second one–––that is *not* allowed! Also, no matter which choice the student
selects (a), (b), or (c), this only counts for *one* of his/her two allowable options in his/her college career.

Winter Study Project
Students must pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter
Study Projects must be submitted by the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of a dean. Students who
fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Committee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency. (See
“Deficiencies,” page 13 of this document. ) Students who fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives
a second Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following
spring or fall semester.

Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing. These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following
numerical equivalents in calculating grade averages:
A+ = 4.33
A = 4.00
A– = 3.67

B+ = 3.33
B = 3.00
B– = 2.67

C+ = 2.33
C = 2.00
C– = 1.67

D+ = 1.33
D = 1.00
D– = 0.67

E=0

A permanent record of each student’s grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any academic action by the College.
A transcript of a student’s cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar’s Office upon written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who
are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student Handbook.

First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their
academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a matter of routine. The Dean’s Office may inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings.

Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:

♦for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last day of reading period.
♦for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the third-to-last day of
the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these
deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the case of
serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satisfactory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make
up the exercises.
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.

Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. A student may not repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded. If
the student fails a course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second
semester only. If a failure occurs in the second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the approval of the
Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar, at a regionally accredited four-year college or university;
(The grade will not, however, be included in the calculation of the student’s cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of a first-semester failure of a year-long language course, obtain a grade of at least a C minus in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure
for the first semester will, however, remain on the student’s record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than
the following fall semester. A student may, in consultation with the Dean’s Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.

15

Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain
reasonable standards of academic achievement. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail to meet the
following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic
reminder, be placed on academic probation, or be required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement on two
conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to
complete work toward a degree at Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss
loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to
meet them by earning grades of at least C minus elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three years unless
stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.

Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the College. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and
self evaluation, can prove to be beneficial educationally. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than three years.
Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean’s Office and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the
end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the drop/add
period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of
eight allowed to complete the degree. If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal and the
courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up before returning to the College.

Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described here.

Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors
or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department chair and the
Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major Winter Study
Project, the student must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field normally will not be allowed
to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls
below these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their
major programs in the “Courses of Instruction” section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.

Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in the student government, or other organization as a
member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is declared ineligible:

1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a violation of the Honor Code.

Dean’s List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are placed on the Dean’s List for that semester.

Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two
elections of new members for each class, at the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided
they have met the requirements and have completed enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who leaves
Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above procedures.
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class, ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for
election provided they have met the requirements.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years’ standing. No more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible
to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may,
upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of Williams College who is a member of another chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular member of the Williams chapter.

16

10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or an officer of administration, any member of another chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any other officer
of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privileges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.

Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students who have completed the requirements as to courses and
grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No degree in
absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid
College charges or have not returned all books belonging to the library.

Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be conferred upon those members of the graduating class who have
passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained a four-year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class — Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class — Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class — Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude

ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is offered to students. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers and some special programs are available to
help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of the academic and intellectual opportunities available at the College.
In the first-year, each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is either a member of the faculty or an administrative officer whose responsibilities keep him or
her in close contact with the curriculum of the College. The Deans of the College also advise undergraduates and coordinate the first-year advising program, review
the academic progress of individual students, and—when appropriate—call students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students continue to meet with their first-year advisors and it is recommended that they seek advice from deans and instructors, along with
pre-professional and other special advisors (click here for a list). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and requirements with faculty members
from departments and programs in which they have an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.
In the junior and senior years, students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs. Each department or program determines its own advising
system for its majors, although chairs are regularly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Academic Resources Office. Any student who desires extra help in a course in which
she or he is registered may request a tutor who has been recommended by the relevant department to the Academic Resources Office; costs of this tutoring are
covered by Academic Resources. The Math and Science Resource Center (MSRC), a drop–in help center staffed by student tutors who come highly recommended
from the appropriate departments, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102, and 202, Chemistry 151, 153, 155, 156, 251, 255, and 256, Mathematics 100, 101,
103, 104, 105, and 106, and Physics 131, 132, 141, and 142. The MSRC (which is open from 8 pm to midnight Sundays through Thursdays throughout both
academic semesters) works in close cooperation with faculty teaching those courses.
All students are encouraged to take full advantage of these academic resources.
STUDY AWAY AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
Advising of Williams students wishing to study away in the junior year is coordinated by the Dean’s Office. Information sessions are held during the fall semester
and early spring of the sophomore year for students wishing to study away. Orientation, advising and counseling of international students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean’s Office.

ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty by signing
an Honor Code pledge at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laboratory reports as well as all quizzes, hour tests, and examinations. For a self-directed citation tutorial, please see The Eph Survival Guide at: www.williams.edu/resources/
acad_resources/survival_guide. For a complete description of honor and discipline procedures, please see: committees.williams.edu/c/group-names/faculty-standingcommittees/discipline/honor-system/

Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has always depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic honesty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations
governing work stipulated by the instructor. Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the misrepresentation of
another’s work, has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting
of the eight student members of the joint Faculty-Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or innocence
of the accused person or persons and for recommending to the Dean appropriate punishments. Several faculty members sit with the Student Honor Committee in an
advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A
recommendation for dismissal must be made by unanimous vote of those present and shall be carried out only with the assent of both the Dean and the President of
the College.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those
voting support the amendment. These alterations must be ratified by the faculty.
Adopted 1971

Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or
laboratories and to explain such guidelines to their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book, alternate-seating
classroom exercises to open-book, “take-home” examinations or papers, and any requirements for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation
among students but others do not. If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to find out from
his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only
as long as both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In all written material, including ungraded assignments and drafts, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are
further advised to consult a recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that particular sources have contributed to the student’s final work.
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1. A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs) must always be identified by quotation marks, by
indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2. A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3. Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though expressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a
note stating the source.
4. In every instance, the use of another student’s laboratory reports, computer programs, or other material must be acknowledged by a note.
5. Even the use of a student’s own previous or concurrent work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain the prior permission of all instructors
concerned before submitting substantially all or part of the same paper in more than one course.
Note: Attempts to gain academic advantage by misleading a professor are violations of the Honor Code. For example, if a student claims to have handed in
an assignment, that work must actually have been submitted.

Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty who wish to report what they suspect to be violations of the Honor Code should contact the faculty or student chairperson of the Honor Committee, who will also inform the Dean’s Office of the suspected violation. If, in consultation with the faculty chair of the Honor Committee, the dean determines that
there is sufficient evidence to warrant a hearing, the Dean’s Office will arrange a meeting of the Honor Committee with the accused student(s) and any relevant faculty
members. A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet.
In advance of the hearing, the student chair of the Honor Committee will meet with the accused student(s) to explain the hearing procedures, review generally the
evidence that led to the accusation, and discuss what the accused student(s) will need to do to prepare for the hearing.
An accused student may also have in attendance at the hearing an advisor of his or her choice from the student body, faculty, or staff of the College. The advisor
helps with the preparation for the case and may be present when the case is heard but may not directly address the Committee during the hearing.
At the hearing, the person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her
own defense, both with and without the accuser present. If the accused student speaks without the accuser present, the Committee may, but need not, apprise the
accuser of the accused student’s account, for the accuser’s response. After both the accused student and the accuser have left the proceedings, the Committee will
determine if a violation has occurred and, if so, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. A finding that a violation has occurred requires a vote of at least
three-quarters of those present. A recommendation for dismissal requires a unanimous vote of those present.
Depending on the nature and circumstances of the violation, the penalty(ies) imposed by the Dean may include but are not limited to a directed grade of E in the
course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the College. A dismissal from the College may be made only upon the unanimous recommendation of the Committee members who heard the case and must be approved by the President.
The accused student may request a reconsideration of the Committee’s decision on the basis of substantial new evidence or improper procedures. A request for
reconsideration must be made in writing to one or both of the Committee chairs within one week of the Committee’s decision, or the decision is deemed to be

19

accepted. A request for reconsideration may be granted by a vote of a majority of the Committee members who heard the case. The Committee may reconsider the
case in its entirety, or one or more aspects of the case, and in doing so may receive or review any information it determines in its discretion is relevant to the reconsideration. Following its reconsideration, the Committee will refer its decision to the Dean for the Dean’s action, if any, as appropriate. There is no right to seek reconsideration of any decision by the Dean.

EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and
annual contributions from its alumni and friends have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.

Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are sent electronically to students twice a year (in mid-July and mid-December) for payment on August 15 and
January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester’s classes begin or the student may not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with outstanding balances or current activity will be issued
monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a
transcript.

student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all undergraduates as part of the College term bill.

**Travel

expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is added into each successful financial aid candidate’s

award.

Additional Items
A Residential House Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill at the rate of $25 each semester. It is used to provide a base
for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged
at the rate of $25 each semester. Co-op residents and off-campus residents are charged a $25 Neighborhood ?Residential Fee each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that all full- and part-time students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must
participate in a qualifying student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording comparable coverage.
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. Students may waive participation in the College’s plan if the student certifies prior to
August 1, 2013 at www.gallagherkoster.com/williams that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is comparable to the plan offered by
the College. Students enrolled in the College’s plan for 2013-2014 will be charged $1,228 for this coverage.
Information about the student health insurance plan offered by the College is e-mailed to every student in June. Questions about the College’s plan or about the
online waiver/enrollment process should be directed to the Koster Insurance Agency at 800-406-5205 or by e-mail at williamsstudent@gallagherkoster.com
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.

Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the
Candidate’s Reply Date of May 1. The deposit appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College term bills for one half of the annual comprehensive fee are issued electronically to students twice a year—in July payable in August and in December
payable in January. Students are encouraged to grant access to their “e-bill” to parents and other parties to be able to view and pay the student’s term bill online.
Payments may be made by electronically by ACH, by check, money order or wire transfer or by credit card, MasterCard, Discover or American Express. Credit card
payments are subject to a 2.99% convenience fee.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail
it to the Financial Aid Office by early June. Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct loans for which a
promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships
which have not yet been received and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Installment Payment Plan (5-month
plan for each term). If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date anticipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from
the student’s account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as “account closed” or “insufficient funds” will be charged to the student’s term bill and a “return check
charge” of $25.00 will be assessed. The College reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or
remain in residence at the College. Furthermore, if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected payments
are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.

21

If efforts by the Bursar’s Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists,
the College’s experience with the account may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reasonable costs
associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate,
he/she should notify the College c/o The Bursar’s Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing
Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program. Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the charges for each term are paid in 5 equal installments (June
through October for fall term and November through March for spring term), with no interest charges. There are no income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the
total cost for each term (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent loans) divided by 5. There is an administration fee per term for this program. Information on this
program is sent each spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216-4258.

ENDOWED SCHOLARSHIPS AND TUTORIALS
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed scholarships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are automatically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required. Limited space
prohibits the complete listing of these, but some deserve special mention because of their distinctiveness.
BRONFMAN FAMILY FUND—Established in 1990 as part of the Third Century Campaign for international programs. The family’s support provides financial
aid both for students coming to Williams from foreign countries and for students spending part of their undergraduate years overseas.
CLASS OF 1936 MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP—Established in 1986 by members of the Class of 1936 and their families and friends as its 50th Reunion gift to

These scholarships are the most distinctive awards presented each year to six to eight of the most promising scholars in the first-year class. Tyng Scholars are also eligible for
assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.

Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President James A. Garfield’s (Class of 1856) legendary statement: “The
ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of the log and a student on the other.” They forge student-professor bonds, teach students about arguments, about arriving at
and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to questions, criticisms, and suggestions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct
analyses, and oral defense.
The College recognizes the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for supporting tutorials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts.
Williams is also pleased to recognize the following individuals and families who have created generous endowments to support tutorials, many in honor of their 25th
and 50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, Robert L. Guyett 1958, The Hunter Family, John D. Mabie 1954, and John H. Simpson 1979, The
Testa Family.

PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may
pursue, the College recognizes that no fundamental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary, a foundation
of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and
enrichment as circumstances permit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Students should consult the departmental programs listed under
“Courses of Instruction” for requirements, and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the appropriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy at many graduate schools are
required to have a reading knowledge of both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many graduate schools
require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candidates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge
of either French or German. Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific fields of study.

Visual Arts
Students interested in graduate studies in art or architecture should meet with faculty with whom they have completed advanced work in the areas they wish to
pursue. Their counsel and that of the Department of Art Academic Advisor, Ed Epping, can help the student narrow the search of programs that would best match the
student’s needs. The specific requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of Fine Arts is available from their online resource.
The College Art Association (CAA) has written:

“Admission to (graduate) programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate level; therefore,
a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the applicant
has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA candidacy,
allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree.”
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recommended courses.

Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in
business, and which graduate business schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral exposition; a good
understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations
and goals. This means that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those
interested in production management or operation research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession. Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to
undertake a broad educational program in the arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities, one holds a leadership
position, and pursuing relevant summer internships is critical.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Pre-MBA Advisor, Robin Meyer, at the Career Center.

Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical management. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should major in one of the
sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while pursuing a broad liberal arts education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete
a Williams B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading to a master’s degree or doctorate in engineering. While it
may be necessary to make up a few undergraduate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of a liberal
arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their careers.
The “Pre-Engineering” webpage can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website. It contains a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains
exchange programs with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Williams
students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year. Please see the “Exchange Programs” section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program offers an opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level at Columbia. Please see
the “Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering” section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering.
Many more details about pre-engineering.

Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal arts education. As a rule, law schools do not require particular pre-law
curriculum for undergraduates. Consequently, application and admission to law school is open to qualified students from all academic disciplines. This does not

24

mean, however, that law schools are indifferent to one’s undergraduate academic experience. In fact, law schools will be very conscious of the quality and rigor of
one’s undergraduate education. A serious student, considering law school, will heed this advice and undertake a challenging program.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Michelle Shaw ’95, at the Career Center. Also, on a regular basis, law schools from
around the country will visit Williams to provide information and to answer questions from potential applicants. Check the WCC calendar for notice of these visits.

The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek
guidance from the Health Professions Advisor within the Career Center.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student
should acquire volunteer service and field-specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any major can be
studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses required for graduate school admission. In certain fields,
upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequisites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in “Choosing First Year Courses,” but each student
considering advanced study in health fields should meet with the Health Professions Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will satisfy
admissions requirements.
Jane Cary, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps that might help a student realize them. Detailed information is available
at the Health Professions website (http:careers.williams.edu/students/advanced-study/pre-health-2/).

Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in college teaching and research should prepare themselves
at Williams for graduate work in the subject of their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state certification
and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at
Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the Director of the Program in Teaching. Additional advice for both of these options is also available at the Career Center.

Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching. Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify
public school teachers, and many states offer a wide range of options for acquiring certification while you teach.
Students interested in teaching may want to consider participating in the Program in Teaching at Williams which is designed to enable undergraduates to study the
ideas, questions, and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program is open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels
of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study (see page ? for more details). Students should contact Susan Engel, the Director
of the Program, to find out how they might participate in the program.
Students who want career advice should contact the Career Center which has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that includes many private
schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at
independent elementary- or secondary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after graduation from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Career Center.

Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students intending to prepare for a career as a religious professional,
enroll in a seminary or pursue theological education. Undergraduate study in many fields within the liberal arts curriculum can be useful to the prospective minister,
priest, rabbi, imam, or teacher of religion.
Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to
concentrated undergraduate study in the field, in consultation with faculty advisors in the Department of Religion.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional in a field such as chaplaincy, religious education or some
other form of ministry are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy) as soon as these interests begin to
come into focus. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious community or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study or field experience during the college years. Many divinity schools and theological seminaries expect and welcome
students whose understanding of “ministry” or sense of call is very much still in formation. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly helpful—sacred
texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies, etc. Undergraduate study in other disciplines —music and the arts, political
science and economics, anthropology, psychology and sociology—may also enhance preparations at the graduate level for future service to communities of faith.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Policy Economics
The Center for Development Economics (CDE), which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an intensive one-year program in economic analysis leading to
the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Economics. The program is specifically designed for economists from developing countries who have already embarked on
professional careers in the public sector. The curriculum requires courses in development economics, macroeconomics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE
fellows choose among other courses in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats. Course electives for 2013-2014 include the following: developing country macroeconomics II; finance and development; empirical methods in macroeconomics; computable general equilibrium modeling; tax policy; incentives in development; urbanization; international financial institutions; long–term fiscal challenges; the role of social safety nets; and micro-simulation for policy analysis. Williams undergraduates who satisfy course prerequisites, with the consent of the individual instructor, are encouraged to take courses at the CDE. Admission to the master’s degree
program is highly selective, with several hundred applicants each year for approximately 30 places. Candidates normally have a B.A. or B.Sc. degree with honors in
economics or a related field, two or more years of relevant work experience, and an effective command of spoken and written English. CDE fellows are often
nominated for the program by public agencies from which they will be on leave.
More information is available on the CDE website, cde.williams.edu. All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Economics should be
addressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.

Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the
History of Art. The objective of the program is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in the visual arts, including
schools and museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at institutions offering higher graduate degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in a wide range of art historical subjects. Opportunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at The Clark, the Williams College
Museum of Art, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, and other local collections. The study of primary materials is further extended by field trips to
other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six
must be graduate seminars (including ARTH 504 and ARTH 506). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register
for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of
these two, German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a European study trip with selected faculty; in January
of the second year, students must complete a draft of their Qualifying Paper. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a
shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter the program a successful applicant must have
been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art history is not required for acceptance to the
program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williamstown, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413) 458-9545, or

AFRICANA STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor GRETCHEN LONG
Core Faculty: BRAGGS, LONG, J. MANIGAULT-BRYANT, R. MANIGAULT-BRYANT, MUTONGI*, ROBERTS, SINGHAM, D.L. SMITH**. Visiting Sterling Brown Professor: FORNA
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Africana Studies Program is an interdisciplinary concentration offering students an in-depth understanding of the history, politics, religion, and culture of peoples of
African descent, especially in the Americas. We use music, dance, literature, the arts, and scholarly works to explore the origins of this field of study in the fulcrum of African
American and Caribbean movements of resistance. A trans-national program, intellectually influenced by scholars from W. E. B. Du Bois to the present, Africana Studies
encourages students to study abroad, especially in our Williams in Africa program, and offers travel Winter Study courses designed to expose students to experiential learning
settings outside of the classroom.

CONCENTRATION IN AFRICANA STUDIES
Candidates for a concentration in “Africana Studies: African Americans, Africans, and the Diaspora” complete two required core courses and three electives, for a total of five
courses. The required core courses are AFR 200 as an introductory course; and one of the two AFR 400-level senior seminar capstone courses, which emphasize special topics or
themes each year. In 2013-2014, the two senior seminar choices are AFR 406 Fall 2013 Crafting Research: Methods in Africana Studies, and AFR 444 Spring 2014 The Black
Republic--Haiti in History and Imagination. Additional courses may be taken with affiliated faculty and visiting professors associated with the program. We encourage students
to take at least one course in a program/department other than Africana Studies and consider an experiential learning Winter Study session; however, the majority of your courses
should be selected from among those offered by Africana Studies core faculty, including our visiting Sterling Brown Professor.

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIES
A student wishing to do honors must complete an “Honors Dossier” during the Winter Study term and Spring semester of their Senior Year. This Dossier is comprised of three
linked essays. Students may begin the project with two essays written for Africana Studies courses and, under their advisor’s guidance complete additional research, incorporate
instructor feedback, and substantially re-write and expand these two papers. The third essay must be a new work, written specifically for the Honors project. Students must also
write a substantive introduction that explains the theme (theoretical, geographic, chronological etc.) that connects the three essays. The introduction should address the significance of the theme to the interdisciplinary study of the peoples and cultures of the African diaspora. It should also explain the logic of the three papers and how they work
together. Dossiers will be due in Mid April (after Spring Break). Under some circumstances, a student may want to include a record of a performance or piece of visual art in the
Dossier. In this case, a written analysis and explanation should accompany that piece. The total Honors Dossier should consist of no less than 45 pages of written work.
Students should submit a proposal for an Honors Dossier in the fall semester of their Senior year, no later than mid October. They may draw on papers written in Africana
courses during any semester including the fall semester of their Senior Year. Students may petition to include a paper written for a course outside of the Africana curriculum.
Africana faculty will meet late in the fall semester to approve or decline Honors Dossier proposals. Students whose proposals are approved will be assigned an advisor and should
register for W31-AFR 494 in the winter study/spring of the Senior Year.
At the Honors presentation night in the spring, each Honors student will prepare and give an oral defense of their dossier. During the defense, students will present the key
points their overarching project and field questions from select faculty and student critics, all of whom will have read the dossier.

AFRICANA STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students concentrating in Africana Studies are encouraged to pursue concentrations in American Studies, Environmental Studies, Latino/a Studies, Performance Studies , and
Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies. Many of the courses counted for these concentrations may also earn credit toward the Africana Studies concentration.

Africana Studies courses required for the concentration:
AFR 200 Introduction to Africana Studies

34

AND one of the following two AFR 400-level Senior Seminar capstone courses (not all 400-level courses meet the requirement for the concentration):

AFR 132 Contemporary Africana Social and Political Philosophy (Same as AMST 132 and PSCI 132) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This introductory seminar investigates the relationship between three major schools of thought in contemporary Africana social and political philosophy, namely the African, Afro-American, and Afro-Caribbean intellectual traditions. We will discuss a range of thinkers including Aimé Césaire, Angela Y. Davis, Édouard Glissant, Lewis R.
Gordon, Kwame Gyekye, Paget Henry, bell hooks, Charles W. Mills, Nkiru Nzegwu, Lucius Outlaw, Oyèrónke Oyewùmi, Tommie Shelby, and Sylvia Wynter. A primary
goal of the course is to provide students with the intellectual resources to decipher problems central to philosophical discourse and to allow students an opportunity to apply
what they learn to critical issues in current geopolitics. This seminar is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, and as such we shall investigate—via the authors mentioned—comparative philosophical analyses, critical theorization, and the plurality of global thinking in contemporary social and political philosophy.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation, two 5- to 7-page essays, and one 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12). Enrollment preference: first- and second-year students.

JAFFE

AFR 156 Thirteen Ways of Looking at Jazz (Same as AMST 156, COMP 156, and ENGL 223) (Not offered 2013-2014)(W) (D)
Taking its title from the Wallace Stevens poem, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” which interprets the blackbird in different ways, this course similarly explores a more
complex, multi-layered perspective on jazz, from jazz and American democracy to jazz in visual art. Accordingly, the course introduces students to several genres, including
historical documents, cultural criticism, music, literature, film, photography and art. The course does not draw on a musicological method but rather a socio-cultural analysis of
the concept, music and its effect—so students are not required to have any prior musical knowledge or ability. In this writing intensive course, students will write short close
analyses of multiple types of media, ultimately building up to an argumentative essay. This EDI course explores the musical expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of
African descent in the New World, as well as the myriad ways in which representations of jazz signify on institutional power, reaffirm dominant U.S. and/or European hierarchies
of race, gender and class, and signal inequality in order to contest it.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one quiz, weekly 2-page response essays in course journal, two 4-page close analyses, one oral presentation/performance with 2-page critical report, and one 6- to 8-page argumentative essay, totaling slightly over 20 pages of written work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). No preference.

AFR 193 Black Power Abroad: Decolonization in Africa, the Caribbean and Europe (Same as HIST 193) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
Obama’s recent successful bid for the Presidency has reminded Americans of the strong links between African-Americans and Africans and of the international dimensions of
the struggle for racial justice. This struggle has its roots in the post-World War II transformation of the world associated with the decolonization struggles led by individuals like
C.L.R. James, Aimé Césaire, Kwame Nkrumah, Franz Fanon and Nelson Mandela. This course will examine this movement, focusing on activists in the Caribbean and Africa,
the new ideas and cultural movements they inspired (Pan-Africanism, Negritude, and Socialism), their organizational activities in London and Paris, and their success in breaking
free of European imperialism only to be confronted with American and Russian Cold War rivalry. By comparing and contrasting different experiences of independence—in the
Caribbean, in independent Ghana, and in anti-apartheid South Africa—this course will grapple with the ways in which racism, political power, and cultural difference affected
relations between Blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indians in these countries as they fought for independence. The comparative and transatlantic scope of this course, combined
with its focus on race relations, power, and privilege helps it meet the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: discussion. Requirements: Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1 short paper, and a 10- to 12-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students, and then sophomores who have not previously taken a 100-level seminar: Preference also given to future Africana Studies concentrators.

200-Level Courses
AFR 200(F,S) Introduction to Africana Studies (Same as AMST 200)
This course introduces students to the content and contours of Africana Studies as a vibrant field of knowledge. Through exploration of the genealogy, disciplinary diversity, and
evolution of the field, we will examine the depth and range of experiences of African-descended peoples throughout the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa. We will
also give some attention to how members of the Diaspora remember and encounter Africa, as well as their diverse responses to the history of enslavement, colonialism, apartheid,
racism, and globalization. Through materials that embrace both historical and contemporary perspectives, we seek to help students develop critical frameworks for understanding
African diasporic experience while simultaneously illumining disjunctures and challenges for the field. This course features two pedagogical strategies: 1) a rotational, interdisciplinary approach that includes the expertise, methods, and specializations of Africana faculty; and 2) the incorporation of aesthetic materials—film, photography, music, dance,
performance, and artwork—to enhance student ability to draw ongoing connections between visual and textual sources covered in the course. Close textual analysis, vibrant
debate, and engaging discourse are expected!
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, weekly reading response papers, two short essays, and a final research project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit fall: 20; spring: none (expected fall: 15; expected spring 25). Preference to underclassmen who are considering concentrating in Africana

AFR 205(F) Introduction to African Literature: Witness Literature (Same as ENGL 269)
After the television images, the photographs and the news stories, come the writers. In the words of Nobel prize–winning South African writer Nadine Gordimer, it is the role and
duty of the writer “to bear inward witness,” for the power to transform traumatic events through literature is the “awesome responsibility of their endowment with the seventh
sense of the imagination.”
’Witness literature’ is an emerging canon, the concept of which can be applied to much African literature of the past fifty years, including the work of Aminatta Forna, novelist
and memoirist who will lead this course. From this perspective we’ll study novels, novellas and short stories and examine how a range of writers portray political events through
their writing, work to extract meaning from violence, convey the ways of resistance and demonstrate the power of memory. We will read the work of Ngugi wa Thiongo,
Ahmadou Kourouma and Chinua Achebe, as well as those of the continent’s new voices: Helon Habila, Brian Chikwava, Petina Gappah and Uwem Akpan.

MUPARUTSA

AFR 207(F) Hip-Hop and Political Theory (Same as PSCI 212)
This course is an introduction into the theoretical underpinnings of the genesis and evolution of hip-hop, a late modern phenomenon whose forms are routinely referred to as a
movement, a culture, a music, and a politics. Since its emergence in the South Bronx during the late 1970s, what constitutes the organizing definitions and philosophical bulwarks
of hip-hop are often underexplored. The course illuminates such submerged, neglected, and contested bodies of knowledge by focusing on eight concepts: justice, rights, recognition, freedom, equality, democracy, love, and judgment. Through these principles, students are able to address how we frame questions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class,
authenticity, the public sphere, incarceration, and globalization. Our meetings consider the popular and the underground, the originally forged and the remixed, the utility of
nomenclature bifurcating conscious and radical hip-hop on the one hand and alternative modes following the logic of neoconservatism and neoliberalism on the other, examining
throughout the interplay among language, aesthetics, and form. We investigate as well whether hip-hop in the United States and around the world is intrinsically a political,
anti-political, or neutral force in the realm of politics. Written texts, lyrical thought, breaking, film, music videos, and guest lectures by rappers, R&B singers, DJs, academics, and
graffiti artists are interwoven in assignments and in-class discussions. Through these mediums and select experiential education opportunities outside the classroom, students
have an opportunity to render evaluations on the political theory of hip-hop between past and future.
Format: lecture. Requirements: attendance and participation, two 5- to 7-page essays, and choice of a final 10-page paper or final project; students opting for a final project must
receive instructor approval and convey the contours of a core course concept through one of the following mediums: video interviews with visiting artists and scholars, a PowerPoint presentation, original song, mixtape, or combined multimedia presentation.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

ROBERTS

AFR 208T(S) Time and Blackness (Same as AMST 208T and REL 262T) (W)
The concept of time is one of the most examined, yet least theorized, concepts in Africana Studies. While the field is saturated with historical studies and literary analyses that
take up issues of cultural memory, both of which involve thinking about time, time itself is rarely the subject of sustained inquiry. This may be due to its abstractness as an idea
and the level of analysis its conceptualization demands, or because time in the African American experience cannot be understood outside of the meaning of race, which itself is
far from tangible. In this tutorial, “Time and Blackness,” we will explore how African American writers across a number of genres understand time. We will read select texts of
fiction as well as spiritual autobiographies, historical narratives, and sociological studies to understand how writers draw from—and create—paradigms of time to organize their
work. The following questions will structure our investigation: What are the constituent elements of time in African American writing? How does race shape the ways a writer
conceives of the experience of time? In examining writings across genres, is there something that we can call an identifiable African-American “timescape”?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: assignments will include six 2-page response papers; two 5-page writing assignments; and a final, 10-page review essay on how time is understood in a genre of writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to concentrators in Africana Studies, majors in Religious Studies, and majors in American Studies.

AFR 211 Race and the Environment (Same as AMST 211, ENVI 211 and SOC 211) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
In contemporary societies, race remains an enduring impediment to the achievement of equality. Generally understood as a socially meaningful way of classifying human
bodies hierarchically, race manifests itself in a number of arenas, including personal experience, economic production and distribution, and political organization. In this
course, we will explore how race emerges in local and global environmental issues, like pollution and climate change. We will begin with a review of some of the landmark
texts in Environmental Studies that address “environmental racism,” like Robert Bullard’s Dumping in Dixie and David Pellow’s Garbage Wars. We will examine how and
to what extent polluting facilities like landfills, oil refineries, and sewage treatment plants are disproportionately located in communities of color; we will also pay attention
to how specific corporations create the underlying rationale for plotting industrial sites. After outlining some of the core issues raised in this scholarship, we will turn to
cultural productions—like literature, film, and music—to understand how people of color respond to environmental injustice and imagine the natural world. By exploring
the myriad ways in which people of color confront, negotiate and challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race and environmental injustice, this class fulfills the EDI requirement.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, 2-3 short papers (5-7 pages), and a self-scheduled final examination.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20). If this class is overenrolled, preference will go to Africana Studies concentrators.

AFR 213T(S) Race, Gender, and the Alien Body: Octavia Butler’s Science Fiction (Same as WGSS 213T) (W)
Science fiction is a genre well known for its ability to envision new realities, and Octavia E. Butler (1947-2006) is among the most highly regarded science fiction writers.
Butler’s uncanny ability to imagine the future anew and to merge those ruminations with her experiences as an African American woman provide powerful commentary on—
and often disrupt—modern understandings of race, gender, and human embodiment. We will explore questions such as: What role does ’gender’ play in Butler’s fiction? How
does Butler’s treatment of the ’alien’ cause us to reconsider what it means to be human? How does Butler incorporate ’race’ and the concept of ’other’ into her fiction, and how do
these techniques help us situate contemporary discussions of a post-race society? We will examine the relationship between Butler’s visions for the future and what her narratives
of future worlds invariably suggest about the present. We will read key texts including the best-selling text Kindred (1979), the haunting dystopian novel Parable of the Sower
(1994), the popular vampire text Fledgling (2005), and the collection Bloodchild and Other Stories (1996). We will also explore contemporary engagement with Butler’s work
including the relationship between the main character from her book Dawn (1987), and Henrietta Lacks, the African American woman from whom the immortal cell line (HeLa)
used for medical research derives. This tutorial will engage Octavia Butler’s work broadly, and with particular attention to how the concepts ’race,’ ’gender’, ’alien’ and ’body’
are interrogated in her writings.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: attendance, paired weekly reflection/response papers, a 5- to 7-page creative writing assignment, and a final essay of 10 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to students with interests and/or prior coursework in Africana Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality
Studies.

Althea Gibson to the Williams Sisters. Julius (Dr. J) Irving to Michael Jordan. Jesse Owens to Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Throughout the 20th century, black athletes have
broken through Jim Crow restraints, challenged racial stereotypes, and taken their sports to new heights of achievement. In this course, students will explore a range of black
athletes in the 20th century, paying particular attention to the attitudes, stereotypes and experiences they endured. In addition, this course will prompt students to analyze the
representation, perception, and commodification of black athletes in popular media forms. Students will trace trends, shifts and themes in representations of blackness across
different sports and historical periods. Topics under study may include resistance against and affirmation of athletes as role models, racial slurs in sports broadcasting, common
themes in commercialized images of the black male athlete, and distinctions in media coverage based on race and gender. Texts will include everything from critical essays and
sociological studies to commercials and documentary films. In their final projects, students may put their newfound knowledge to the test by exploring their campus or hometown to investigate the role that race plays on their own playing field.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, short weekly reading and/or listening assignments, one 5-page paper, final group project.

This course is designed to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the historical development and changing dynamics of race in North America, the Caribbean, and
South America. In doing so, we will take on the fundamental position that race is a meaningful classification of human bodies. The question we will keep in front of us at all times
is this: How does social milieu determine the meaningfulness of race? Racial classifications, like all classifications, are collectively imagined, and appear mired in various spheres
of social life. We will devote a fair amount of attention to the meaning of race in personal experience, economic production and distribution, political organization, and popular
culture. The complexity of race will be explored within a number of writings by authors such as Michael Hanchard, Edwidge Dandticat, and Patricia Hill Collins. This EDI
course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the New World, as well as the myriad ways in which they confront,
negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. and/or European social hierarchies.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, 2-3 short papers (5-7 pages), and a self-scheduled final examination.

AFR 299(S) Rastafari: Dread, Politics, Agency (Same as PSCI 233 and REL 261)
The emergence of Rastafari in the twentieth century marked a distinct phase in the theory and practice of political agency. From its heretical roots in Jamaica, Garveyism,
Ethiopianism, and Pan-Africanism, Rastafari has evolved from a Caribbean theological movement to an international political actor. This course investigates the political theory
of Rastafari in order to develop intellectual resources for theorizing the concept of agency in contemporary Africana thought and political theory. We will analyze texts and
audio-visual works on the political economy of late colonial Jamaica, core Rastafari thinking, political theology, the role of reggae music, the notion of agency, and the influence

AFR 300 Lessons of ‘The Game’: The Wire and American Culture (Same as AMST 300 and SOC 306) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The critically acclaimed television program, The Wire, ran for five seasons on Home Box Office (HBO) between 2002 and 2008. Set in “inner city” Baltimore, the program
addressed a wide array of topics, including, but not limited to, the urban drug trade, law enforcement, local city politics, labor unions, education, and the newspaper industry.
Though a work of “fiction,” sociologist William Julius Wilson has called the show an important and instructive portrayal of the “deep inequality in inner-city America.” By
contrast, some scholars and critics have decried the series and indeed, courses like this one, as examples of mainstream America’s fascination with and acceptance of African
American drug use, criminal tendencies, and corruption. In this course, we will not deconstruct The Wire per se, but use select episodes from the series to explore key issues in
Africana Studies, ranging from political geography to a history of Baltimore and the “War on Drugs.” Students should have some familiarity with the show. Africana Studies will
show select episodes during Winter Study. Readings will include texts about African American urban life, such as Elijah Anderson’s Code of the Street and Sudhir Venkatesh’s
Gang Leader for a Day. Due to its attention to crime, drug addiction, violence, and urban decay, this course is a part of the Gaudino Danger Initiative.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on 2-3 short papers (5-7 pages), and a final written project (10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 50). No preference.

AFR 305 The Sociology of Black Religious Experience (Same as AMST 304, REL 315 and SOC 305) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The United House of Prayer For All People. The Nation of Islam. New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. The African-American Buddhist Retreat at Spirit Rock Meditation
Center. While each of these groups reflects a different spiritual tradition, all are examples of the rich religious expressions of Black Americans. This course will introduce students
to the landscape of Black religious practices in the United States. We will begin with a historical survey of the literature on Black religions. Our review will yield some of the

37

primary themes of the Black religious experience—the injustices of modern racism, the significance of liberation, and continued meaning of Africa as a homeland. We will then
investigate how secular processes like industrialization, commodification, and the modern media, alter understandings of the sacred in Black experience.

AFR 310 Womanist/Black Feminist Thought (Same as AMST 309, REL 310 and WGSS 310) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course explores the genealogy and development of black feminist and womanist thought. We will investigate the expansion of womanist thought from a theologically
dominated discourse to a broader category of critical reflection associated more commonly with black feminism, analyze the relationship between womanism and black feminism, and review the historical interventions of black feminism. As critical reflections upon western norms of patriarchy, heterosexism, and racism, womanism and black feminism begin with the assumption that the experiences of women of color—particularly black women—are significant standpoints in modern western society. Through the examination of interdisciplinary and methodological diversity within these fields, students will be introduced to key figures including Alice Walker, Zora Neale Hurston, and Katie
Cannon, and will engage materials that draw from multiple fields, including, but not limited to, literature, history, anthropology, and religious studies. Fulfilling the EDI requirement, this course will explore how womanism/black feminism can be a bridge for empathetic understanding of diverse experiences, and will examine the varied social, political,
and historical contexts that led to the formulation of womanism/black feminism as a tool to critique power and privilege.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three short response papers, and the completion of an original research paper or project.

AFR 311 Black Ministerial Imaginations: Griots, Athletes, and Maestros (Same as REL 311) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In one of the most memorable lines from the classic Souls of Black Folk, W. E. B. Du Bois described the Black minister as “the most unique personality developed on U. S. soil.”
This course will draw from Du Bois’s social-psychological portrait of the minister to explore how the ministerial personality appears across a number of social arenas beyond the
religious sphere, including politics, sports, and music. We will investigate the complex social dynamics of race and gender surrounding Black ministerial expressions, such as
Barack Obama’s campaign for the U.S. presidency; Mike Singletary’s career as a Hall of Fame linebacker for the Chicago Bears, motivational speaker, and Head Coach for the
San Francisco 49ers; and John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme.”

AFR 314(F) Groovin’ the Written Word: The Role of Music in African American Literature (Same as AMST 314, COMP 321 and ENGL 314)
In an interview with Paul Gilroy, Toni Morrison once said, “Music provides a key to the whole medley of Afro-American artistic practices.” Morrison is not the only one who
believes that music speaks to numerous aspects of the African American experience. From Sterling Brown and Zora Neale Hurston to John Edgar Wideman and Suzan LoriParks, many African American authors have drawn on music to take political stands, shape creative aesthetics, and articulate black identity. In this course, students will explore
the work of these authors and more, investigating music’s ability to represent and critique African American culture in their literature. Texts will cover a range of literary forms
including poetry, plays, short stories and novels alongside theoretical and critical essays. Students will discuss such key issues as assimilation into mainstream culture, authenticity claims on black music, and music used as a tool for protest. Additionally, class assignments will include musical examples in spirituals/gospel, blues, jazz, and rock/rhythm
and blues. While this class requires students to practice in-depth literary and performance analysis skills, students are not required to have technical musical knowledge.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, short weekly reading responses and/or listening assignments, one 6- to 8-page paper comparing two
works, final group project (possibly producing a radio show/ podcast), and a final written component.

AFR 315 Blackness 2.0: Race, Film and New Technologies (Same as AMST 315) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Media theorists have raised three key questions regarding representations of race (or the lack thereof) within contemporary media forms: (1) Is race a liability in the 21st century
where utopian forecasts suggest a race-free or ‘post-race’ future? (2) Is there more to new media and race than assumptions about a “digital divide”? (3) Are race distinctions truly
eliminated with digital technologies? In this course we will respond to these questions by investigating the nuanced ways that race becomes constructed in popular media forms.
Although we will largely focus on representations of blackness in modern film, we will also explore the implications of ‘new’ medias and technologies upon the categories of
race, gender, and sexuality. We will, for example, consider how avatar-based social and entertainment medias become viable forums for conceptualizing race, and whether or not
these formats are somehow ‘better’ spaces in which racialized ‘bodies’ can exist. Additional discussion topics may include: how racial discourses in the “real world” are (or are
not) reshaped and redefined in the virtual world; blogosphere politics; social networking; gaming and the virtual world; activism on the web; and fandom in the twitter era.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, maintenance and update of a personal blog (including weekly reading-related posts), and the design of a final,
original multimedia project explicitly connected to race and new media or race and new technologies.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 13. (expected 13). Preference: Africana concentrators.

AFR 316 Sacred Cinema: Black Religion and the Movies (Same as AMST 316 and REL 265) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Although they represent different genres, what popular films Madea’s Family Reunion (2006), First Sunday (2008), The Princess and the Frog (2009) have in common is that
they each offer complex and at times contradictory images of black religious expression in North America. These films, which present varied perspectives of African American
experience, implicitly and explicitly engage themes inherent to the study of religion, such as the role of faith in decision-making processes and the use of religious tradition as a
means of reinforcing or contesting socio-cultural norms. This course is as much about the use of film to study black religious expression as it is about the use of paradigms of
religious thought to study the intersections of gender, race, and religion in film. We will study films of different genres to facilitate discussion about the various dimensions of
black religious expression. Conversely, we will use images, metaphors, and teachings found in Religious Studies to discuss what appears on screen. Through interdisciplinary,
critical approaches in Film Studies and Popular Culture Studies, this course will examine how black religious expression pervades modern cinema, and will offer constructive
strategies for engaging in dialogue with this phenomenon.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, film viewings, two review essays, and the completion of an original documentary/short film.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 13 (expected: 13). Preference given to Africana Studies concentrators, Religion majors.

AFR 317(S) Black Migrations: African American Performance at Home and Abroad (Same as AMST 317, COMP 319, DANC 317, ENGL 317 and THEA
317)
In this course, students will investigate, critique and define the concepts migration and diaspora with primary attention to the experiences of African Americans in the United
States and Europe. Drawing on a broad definition of performance, students will explore everything from writing and painting to sports and dance to inquire how performance
reflects, critiques and negotiates migratory experiences in the African diaspora. For example, how did musician Sidney Bechet’s migration from New Orleans to Chicago to
London influence the early jazz era? How did Katherine Dunham’s dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin
go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem? What drew actor/singer Paul Robeson to Russia, and why did the U.S. revoke his
passport in response to his speeches abroad? These questions will lead students to investigate multiple migrations in the African diasporic experience and aid our exploration of
the reasons for migration throughout history and geography.
Format: discussion. Evaluation based upon class participation, one 5- to 7-page paper analyzing a performance/text, student-led class facilitation, final performance/ presentation,
and a final paper.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to Africana Studies concentrators and Comparative Literature and English majors.

AFR 319 Ethnographic Approaches to Africana Studies (Same as AMST 319 and SOC 319) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Ethnography is the systematic study and recording of human cultures. It involves the collection and analysis of information from multiple sources including (but not limited to)
first-person accounts, life histories, interviews, observations, and autobiographical materials. Within Africana Studies, ethnographic approaches have been utilized to reflect
complex narratives of black experience throughout the Diaspora. This seminar is a critical introduction to the theory, method, and practice of ethnography in Africana studies. We
will explore a variety of cultures and settings, and discuss the practical, methodological, and ethical issues related to ethnography. Three broad questions will dominate our
discussions: 1) What are the theoretical, practical, and stylistic tools needed to fashion compelling ethnographies that get to the heart of what it means to document Africana
experience? 2) What are the ethical and political implications of representing Africana perspectives in fieldwork studies? 3) What are the strengths and limitations of ethnography
as a research method in Africana studies? Each student will utilize the materials covered in the course to research and write his or her own ethnography.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, weekly response papers, a 5- to 7-page critical book review, and the construction of a mini-ethnography.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference given to Africana Studies concentrators, especially juniors, Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies and
Religion/Sociology/Anthropology majors.

AFR 320 Dangerous Bodies: Black Womanhood, Sexuality and Popular Culture (Same as AMST 320 and WGSS 320) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Whether presented as maternal saints, divas, video vixens, or bitches, black female celebrities navigate a tumultuous terrain in popular culture. This course considers the ways
that black female celebrities such as Oprah, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé, Janet Jackson, and Michelle Obama negotiate womanhood and sexuality, and the popular landscapes through which we witness that negotiation. It also engages contemporary black feminist scholarship, which most frequently presents the presentation of black female
bodies in popular media forms as exploitive. We will review historical stereotypes of black women in popular media forms, discuss the history of the “politics of respectability”
within black culture, engage black feminist responses to these types, and examine theoretical approaches to assess social constructions of womanhood and sexuality. We will also
consider provocative questions relevant to discussions of contemporary black sexual politics: Should we view these women as feminists? Are they merely representatives of
cultural commodification and control of black women’s bodies? Do these women best exemplify the reiteration of problematic characterizations? Are they positive models for
demonstrating female empowerment, agency, or “fierceness?” This course explores the histories of representation of black female figures in popular culture, and in so doing,
troubles contemporary considerations of black womanhood and sexuality.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, short response papers, and the completion of an original research paper or project.

AFR 323(S) Comic Lives: Graphic Novels & Dangerous Histories of the African Diaspora (Same as AMST 323, ARTH 223, COMP 322, and ENGL 356)
This course explores how the graphic novel has been an effective, provocative and at times controversial medium for representing racialized histories. Drawing on graphic novels
such as Jeremy Love’s Bayou and Ho Che Anderson’s King: A Comic Biography, this course illustrates and critiques multiple ways the graphic novel commingles word and
image to create more sensorial access into ethnic traumas, challenges and interventions in critical moments of resistance throughout history. Students will practice analyzing
graphic novels and comic strips, with the help of critical essays, reviews and film; the chosen texts will center on Africana cultures, prompting students to consider how the
graphic novel may act as a useful alternate history for marginalized peoples. During the course, students will keep a journal with images, themes and reflections and will use
Comic Life software and ipads to create their own graphic short stories based on historical and/or autobiographical narratives.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, weekly written responses, student-led facilitation, one 3-page graphic analysis, one 6- to 8-page essay, and a
final project (producing a graphic short story with Comic Life).

AFR 338 Garveyism (Same as PSCI 338) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course explores the life, work, political thought, and activism associated with the Jamaican Pan-Africanist Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the transnational movement–Garveyism–that Garvey ushered into the modern world. We will investigate the founding of Garveyism on the island of Jamaica, the evolution of Garveyism during the early
twentieth century across the Americas and in Africa, Garveyism in Europe in the mid-twentieth century, and the contemporary branches of the Garvey movement in our own late
modern times. The implications of Garvey’s conflict with W. E. B. Du Bois and the subsequent cleavages in political thought and allegiances among their respective adherents
will be addressed, along with various other core issues including: the relationship between race, nation, and empire; transnationalism; the meaning of power; the limitations of
understanding Garveyism by the phrase “Back-to-Africa”; the moral philosophy of respect, reparation, and redemption; prophetic political theory; Pan-Africanism; the impact of
Garveyism on political theological movements, such as the Nation of Islam and the Rastafari; women in the Garvey movement; and Garveyite strategies for forging models of
political solidarity in dark times.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, weekly online reading response papers, two 5- to 7-page essays, and one 12- to 15-page

decolonial turn in critical theory, a move calling on those both within and outside of Europe to challenge the coloniality of the age and to forge a new vision of politics in the
postcolonial period. This course is an advanced seminar devoted to a comprehensive examination of Fanon’s political thought. We will begin with an analysis of primary texts by
Fanon and end by considering how Fanon has been interpreted by his contemporaries as well as activists and critical theorists writing today.

AFR 405 Africana Studies and the Disciplines (Africana Studies Senior Seminar) (Same as AMST 404) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Of the many things that distinguish Africana Studies from other fields of knowledge, most remarkable are its creative uses and critiques of disciplinary perspectives. In some
instances, a scholar in the field might move between disciplines; in others, a scholar might integrate two or more disciplines into one point of view. Disciplinary creativity
accommodates the array of information—written texts, music, visual art, film—that contributes to our understanding of the African Diaspora. This seminar will illuminate the
disciplinary nuances and challenges of studying people of African descent. After outlining genealogies of Africana Studies and the field’s complicated relationships to social
science disciplines, students will closely read classic texts by some of the pioneers in the field and explore their uses of disciplinary perspectives. In the latter half of the course,
students will have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research projects with the aforementioned disciplinary concerns in mind.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, a couple of short papers and the completion of a final research paper or project.

AFR 406(F) Crafting Research: Methods in Africana Studies (Africana Studies Senior Seminar) (Same as AMST 406)
Any student of Africana Studies swiftly recognizes there is a limitless breadth to what constitutes “Africana experience” and that there are diverse means through which Africana
experience is examined. For example, while some scholars utilize a more historical approach to chronicle Africana experience, others study the black body via performance to
unearth nuanced meanings of Africana experience. This capstone seminar will explore a variety of methods and strategies for crafting research within the field of Africana
Studies. We will focus on approaches that derive from traditional disciplines as well as techniques that have emerged with the advent of dynamic new media and digital technologies. Some of the methodologies we will engage include: historiography; archival research; digital archiving; quantitative data analysis; ethnographic and qualitative analysis;
critical textual analysis; reading the body as art and text; blogging and digital publishing; and evaluating films as text. Serving as a practicum, the course will provide considerable
background in a variety of methods as well as hands-on learning. Students will have the opportunity to craft a final research project that is best explored through one or more of
the methods we examine.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based upon class participation, response papers, and a final research project.

AFR 444(S) The Black Republic: Haiti in History and Imagination (Africana Studies Senior Seminar) (Same as HIST 444) (D)
This senior Africana capstone course/History seminar explores the central role of Haiti in the American and the transnational pan-African imaginations. As home to the world’s
only successful slave rebellion, Haiti has been a role model of tremendous importance, stimulating slave rebellions in America and throughout the Caribbean, playing an instrumental role in the liberation of South America from the Spaniards, and inspiring decolonization movements in Africa and the Caribbean in the 20th century. Not surprisingly, it
has had tumultuous relations with both its colonial occupier, France, and its most powerful neighbor, the United States. From isolation and sanctions, to occupation and U.S.
supported dictatorship, this seminar traces the historical silencing suffered by Haiti at the hands of western historians, the vivid images Haitians evoke in the American imagination—from boat people and carriers of Aids, to practitioners of voodoo and creators of a uniquely African-Caribbean art—and the role of the French and American governments
in the recent coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Film, dance, literature, music, history, anthropology and religion will be explored in this interdisciplinary course, with
an eye towards helping students produce an original work of their own as the final project. By examining Haiti’s fraught racial relations—particularly between Haitian blacks and
mulattoes—and her early and unique black power movement—noirisme—this class fulfills the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on student participation, a short paper, and the completion of an original research paper or project (all projects will have some written
component, but may include a dance performance, spoken word, fieldwork etc.)

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program, an eleven-course major, uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students’ understanding of the complexity of the culture(s) usually
labeled “American.” Examining history, literature, visual media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by
diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and
contemporary theories about how cultures work.

NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements of the departments that sponsor
those courses. Courses designated as junior or senior seminars are open to non-majors with permission of the instructor.

COURSES AND COURSE NUMBERING
American Studies offers courses at all levels. Our 100-level courses, which give preference to first-year students, explore a substantive topic in-depth without seeking to
introduce the field as a whole. Our introductory course, AMST 201, explores questions of American identity but also stresses the interdisciplinary approach and diverse cultural
artifacts that distinguish American Studies as a form of inquiry. Both this course and our occasional 200-level electives are appropriate for students at all levels, including first-

40

years. The intermediate electives at the 300 level are offered primarily for juniors and seniors, although, when space and instructor policy permits, they are open to sophomores
who have had AMST 201. All majors are required to take AMST 301, the junior seminar, which teaches students how to employ theories and methods central to the field. The
400-level courses designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors, though open to others with suitable preparation.

THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
American Studies 301, Junior Seminar
one 400-level course designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specializations listed below, the other three chosen from among any of the electives listed, but students must draw
their remaining courses from two of the other specializations. Students are also required to take at least one course covering pre-1900 American history or culture; this
need not be and additional courses, but can be one of the eight electives.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of
high achievement in courses taken for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who wish to write or produce an honors
project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of spring registration in the junior
year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admission to the
honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee’s assessment of the qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project (including the
availability of relevant faculty advisors). If the proposal is approved, the student will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and AMST 492 the following year. The
completed project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end of spring semester. Honors Theses count as one of the
eleven courses required for the major.

ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester
registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non- majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the
program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.

AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in Africana Studies, Environmental Studies, Latina/o Studies, Performance Studies, and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies. Many of the courses counted for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.

STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if
plans are made carefully. Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they leave; those who can take the Junior Seminar before they go away are
encouraged to do so. Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the requirements of the major.

AMST 108 First-Hand America (Same as ENGL 244) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Gonzo journalism, the nonfiction novel, literary journalism, the “new new journalism.” Before “American Studies” was named and developed as an academic field the study of
American culture thrived in the able hands of writers, reformers and amateur anthropologists whose works continue to form the basis of the curriculum. This course is an
introduction to American culture through the eyes of extraordinary writers who work as public intellectuals, addressing a readership that reaches beyond the university. We will
travel to Alaska with John McPhee, to Miami with Joan Didion, to Sing Sing prison with Ted Conover, and to the Hmong community of Northern California with Ann Fadiman,
examining at every stop both the cultures in which these acute observers immerse themselves and their interpretive techniques. Works will be drawn from the following list of
authors: Jane Addams, Zora Neal Hurston, Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, Studs Terkel, John Edgar Wideman, Peggy Orenstein, Jon Krakauer, Susan
Orlean, and Mitchell Duneier.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, and a combination of critical/analytical writing and creative nonfiction.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies (D)
To be an “American” means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the problems and possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is
shaped by factors such as class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region—categories which themselves change in meaning over time. Given the geographical, racial,
and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals and
groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American
Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the
questions we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape
their visions of Americanness? How do the educational system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are
boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have
Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, two papers, two short response papers, and class participation. (Rúa’s section: 4 short response papers (2 pp), 1 group

AMST 212(F) Race and Capitalism (Same as AFR 215) (W)
This course will grapple with the analysis of capitalism that has emerged out of the Black radical tradition. Examining how the traces of slavery have continued in capitalism
following emancipation, this intellectual and political tradition also foregrounds race as a material, concrete relationship that is visible in the organization of economic life: in the
production of the goods and services necessary for society to reproduce itself. We will focus on Black freedom struggles, and their analyses and proposals towards achieving
radical emancipation and racial justice. This seminar course will involve collaborative and individual research work.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, group work, and a semester-long small group writing project, with each student responsible for 12–15

AMST 215 Experimental Asian American Writing (Same as COMP 215 and ENGL 217) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Asian American literature did not begin in the 1980s with Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. Nor has the writing primarily been confined to autobiographical accounts of generational conflict, divided identities, and glimpses of Chinatown families. Asian American literature in English began with poetry in the late nineteenth century, and has encompassed a variety of aesthetic styles across the last century—from Modernism to New York School poetry to protest poetry to digital poetics. This course will explore Asian
American writings that have pushed formal (and political) boundaries in the past 100+ years, with a particular focus on avant-garde writers working today. We will look at such
authors as Jose Garcia Villa, Chuang Hua, Wong May, Theresa H. Cha, John Yau, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Tan Lin, Prageeta Sharma, Bhanu Kapil, and Tao Lin.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two papers (6-8 pp. and 10-12 pp.) plus in-class presentation, brief response papers, and class participation.

AMST 222(F) Cultural Politics in Asian America (Same as ENGL 289)
Our course aims to think through and theorize cultures and politics of “Asian America.” Our approach to “culture” will be informed by Lisa Lowe’s argument that Asian American cultural forms and practices, particularly in contradiction to nationalist histories and narratives, challenge, imagine, and give rise to alternative subjectivity and critiques.
Asian American culture and cultural politics have always been rooted in material history and experiences of Asian America, neither separate nor distinct from them. Accordingly,
we will examine various sites and practices that have been central to Asian America, including but not limited to: claims to and contestations over citizenship, responses to and
participation in empire–building, access to higher education, and representations in popular culture and media. Our materials will include cultural objects and artifacts as well as
contemporary scholarship in Asian American Studies in these areas. Keeping in mind that Asian American cultures and/or politics have hardly been monolithic or homogeneous,
we will also consider how cultural practices and forms continuously rethink, remake and challenge our conceptions of “Asian America.”
Format: seminar. Requirements: active and consistent in-class participation, 2-3 short response papers, in-class workshop and presentation, final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to American Studies majors.

AMST 230(S) U.S. Imperialism
Since the U.S. invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq, questions of imperialism have returned to the forefront of analyses of life and politics in the United States. This
course will examine a long view of U.S. imperialism, from continental imperialism over Native peoples’ lands, through overseas imperialism following the Spanish-American
War, through the Cold War, and reaching into the War on Terror. We will engage long-standing models in the analysis of empire, and focus on cultural, economic, and political
dimensions to examine the centrality of imperialism to the United States, and the history of the United States within a context of global histories.

AMST 238 Racial Formations and Transformations in America: 1945-Present (Same as ENGL 238) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Sociologist Howard Winant has argued that World War II heralded a significant “break” in racial order: that is, it signaled the beginning of marked shifts in how people—and the
State—perceived, thought about, and managed race and racial inequality. Subsequent decades in the United States witnessed the end of segregation, passage of Civil Rights,
liberalization of immigration policies, and the rise and dominance of “multiculturalism” in social, political, and academic spheres. These landmark events and shifts contributed
to a narrative of progress as the defining story of race in post-war America. However, as Winant cautions, the “break” neither resolved nor abolished racism and racial hierarchies.
Our class will examine how this narrative of racial progress has been constructed, as well as the ways in which it has been critiqued and complicated. In doing so, we will also pay
attention to: shifting perception(s) of race/racial difference in global and transnational contexts, representations of race in cultural texts and discourse, cross-racial connections and
formations, and inter-articulation of gender, sexuality, and class formations with race. This course reflects the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initiative through its comparative
approaches to study of race and in its emphasis on the centrality of racial formations to the structure and logic of national life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active in-class participation, 3-4 short response papers, final project (8-10 pages) and an in-class workshop/presentation of final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to American Studies majors.

AMST 254 Workers’ Stories, Workers’ Lives: Narrative Approaches to U.S. Labor History (Same as HIST 254) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will use novels, comics, poetry, autobiographies, zines, films, and visits to historic sites as windows into the complex histories of work and working-class life in U.S.
history. Reading labor studies texts alongside these literary and cinematic accounts, we will survey major developments in the U.S. economy, labor force, types of work, and the
lives of working people. Topics include: the transition from household economies to wage labor; work regimes under slavery; divergent experiences of immigrant labor and
cultural assimilation; industrialization and the consumer society; deindustrialization and structural unemployment; the sexual division of labor; and the rise of knowledge and
service economies. Throughout, we will focus on ways in which working people cope with or resist the burdens of their work lives and organize to seek greater control over
decisions that affect them, including: union organizing, political engagement, stealing, and sharing their own interpretations and representations of their experiences.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: students may be required to view films outside of class. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a final exam and two projects;
and auto-ethnographic account of a work experience, and an oral history with another individual.

AMST 257 Social Justice Traditions from the 1960s to Occupy Wall Street (Same as HIST 257 and LEAD 257) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In 2011 Time magazine declared “the protestor” the person-of-the-year in acknowledgement of the massive social movements that swept the globe over the previous twelve
months. This course is designed to clarify where movements like Occupy Wall Street came from and to evaluate how they might shape American life and politics in the near
future. Taking a historical approach, we will begin by studying the civil rights, anti-war, counter-culture, and feminist initiatives of the 1960s. We will then explore how progressive and radical activists adjusted their theories and strategies as the country became more conservative in the 1970s and 1980s. Making use of movement documents, documentary films, and a variety of other sources, we will study the development of LGBTQ, ecological, and economic justice initiatives up to the present day. Throughout, we will seek
to understand how movements in the United States are shaped by global events, and how the very idea of “social justice” has been reconfigured in their wake. Students will give
an in-class presentation on a supplementary text and will write a research paper at the end of the term.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: students are required to view films outside of class. Evaluation is based on class participation, four short response papers (2 pp.), two
film reviews, and a final paper (8-10 pp.).

This course examines a sampling of Asian American texts from the late nineteenth century to the present and contextualizes them historically. Produced by writers from various
Asian American groups and in a variety of styles, these works by such writers as Maxine Hong Kingston, Jose Garcia Villa, Younghill Kang, Hisaye Yamamoto, and Linh Dinh,
provide a sense of heterogeneity of Asian American literature. They also force us to examine the intersections, material and psychic, of historical events/larger structural forces
with individuals and groups. Our readings will prod us to call into question assumptions we make about what is “Asian American” but also, crucially, what is “American.” Both
domestic issues (e.g., American politics, racism, links with other minority groups) and global considerations (e.g., U.S. immigration and foreign policies, the three wars with
Asian countries in the last century)—and how they have shaped Asian American histories and literatures—will figure importantly in our discussions.

AMST 301(F) Theories and Methods in American Studies (Junior Seminar)
This course aims to provide a “how to” of American Studies from an integrative, multiracial, and socio-cultural perspective. Taking American culture as a site for testing classic
and contemporary theories about how cultures work, the Junior Seminar in American Studies serves as an introduction to resources and techniques for interdisciplinary research.
Students will be exposed to and experiment with a wide range of current theoretical and methodological approaches employed in American Studies and contributing disciplinary
fields, and in the process gain a working competence in all four tracks of the major (Space and Place; Comparative Studies in Race, Ethnicity and Diaspora; Arts in Context; and
Critical and Cultural Theory). The goal of the course is not only for students to develop knowledge of main currents in the field of American Studies but also to become practitioners through a series of assignments that will permit students to exercise their newfound skills. Students will thus, for instance, develop rhetorical analyses, gather ethnographic
data, and “read” assorted spaces and buildings, as the class explores such problems or topics as national narratives, ethnoracial formations, the American prison system, and the

43

circulation of commodities.
Format: discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation and a wide variety of student assignments, ranging from postings to the class Glow site, to
short, analytical essays (5 pp.), to field work exercises, to in class presentations.
Prerequisites: AMST 201, junior or senior standing, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12). Preference given to juniors majoring in American
Studies.; required of junior majors.

AMST 302 Public Sphere/Public Space (Same as PSCI 335) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The “public sphere,” one of the core concepts of modern democratic thought, has taken on renewed significance in intellectual life today. This writing-intensive seminar looks
briefly at the evolution of the term, but concentrates on its relevance to contemporary politics. Our investigations will center on the character and meanings of public space. We
will look at space both as a key metaphor in political theory and as a medium of everyday practical struggle: that is, we will examine not only some of the most influential
conceptions of public life, but also the political forces shaping and shaped by the practical design and use of the built environment. These examinations will combine critical
reading and analytical writing with field observations, group work, and oral presentations. Our primary focus will be on the following topics: the relationship between ideas of
citizenship and models of the public; the racing, gendering, and class-stratification of spaces (civic, residential, commercial, etc.); urbanity and suburbanization; the kinds of
spaces and politics opened and closed by the internet and contemporary mass media; the effects of contemporary processes of globalization on political identity and democratic
practices. Likely authors include Arendt, Berman, Davis, Delany, Foucault, Fraser, Gamson, Habermas, Hall, Harvey, Holston, Sennett, Sunstein, Virilio.
Format: discussion. Requirements: regular participation in class and on line, one 3-page paper, three 6-page papers, and two ethnographic field exercises/presentations.
Prerequisites: prior work in theory or permission of the instructor; not open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).

AMST 303 Race and Abstraction (Same as AFR 303, COMP 301 and ENGL 344) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Minority artists—writers and visual artists, mainly, and, to a lesser degree, musicians—face a difficult “double bind” when creating works of art: the expectation is that they, like
their racially marked bodies, will exhibit their difference by means of concrete signifiers (details, tropes, narratives, themes) of racial difference. Thus, the work is judged primarily in terms of its embodied sociological content (material, empirical) and not by “abstract” standards of aesthetic subtlety, philosophical sophistication, and so on.
At the same time, in the popular and academic imaginary, minority subjects and artists poets occupy a single abstract signifying category—homogeneous, undifferentiated,
“other,” marginalized, non-universal—while “unmarked” (white) artists occupy the position of being universal and individual at once. The irony, of course, is that, say, an
African American poet’s being read as an abstract signifier does not mean that the black subject or writer is seen as capable of engaging in abstract ideas.
This course will ask questions about the problem of race and abstraction by looking at the work of various African American and Asian American writers, visual artists and
musicians—including Will Alexander, John Keene, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, John Yau, Cecil Taylor, David Hammons, and Yoko Ono—as well as critics. We will pay particular

AMST 305 Cities of the Anglophone Chinese Imagination (Same as ASST 305, COMP 303 and ENGL 374) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
The current academic vogue for the “diasporic” and the “transnational” has shifted the emphasis away from viewing ethnic literatures solely, or primarily, as minority national
literatures and towards reading them more “globally.” Such a re-framing, while potentially exciting, raises new questions. For example, what exactly is shared by subjects in a
given diaspora? Does the term “diaspora”
necessarily invoke the specter of racial essentialism? What happens to concepts of of race, racialization and racism when one moves away from local and national politics? Is the
idea of a diasporic subject much less vexing than the idea of a racially minoritized person? How important a role does the shared English language play in these diasporas? In this
course, we will look at the works of a specific diasporic literary group, English-language writers of Chinese descent, living in England, former British settler colonies (the United
States, Canada, Australia) and other sites in Asia formerly colonized by the British. We will consider how geographic sites function as material spaces and places of the imagination and how the English language is itself a material and imaginary space.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based on one 5- to 7-page paper, one 8- to 10-page paper, short response papers, participation.

AMST 307(F) Experimental African American Poetry (Same as AFR 301, COMP 311, and ENGL 327)
Contemporary African American poets in various cities and towns across the nation—from New York City, Providence, and Newark to Durham, Chicago, and Los Angeles—are currently producing a vibrant and thriving body of formally experimental work, yet this poetry is largely unknown to readers both within and outside the academy.
Formally innovative African American poetry defamiliarizes what we normally expect of “black writing” and also pushes us to question our assumptions and presumptions
about black identity, “identity politics,” experimental writing (is the avant-garde implicitly raced?), formalism, socially “relevant” writing, the (false) dichotomy of form
versus content, the black “community,” digital poetics, and other issues of race and aesthetics.
This course will examine the work of living poets who range in age from 30’s to 80’s, including Amiri Baraka, Ed Roberson, Nate Mackey, Will Alexander, Harryette Mullen,
Tyrone Williams, John Keene, Fred Moten, Erica Hunt, and Renee Gladman. We will also look at the work of some of their avant-garde predecessors in the twentieth century
(such as Bob Kaufman, Gwendolyn Brooks, Norman Pritchard, Russell Atkins), as well as critical work by Mackey, Moten, and Aldon Nielsen, among others.

AMST 310 Race Wars in America (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course examines the ways in which race/racism and war/militarism have operated as mutually constitutive processes throughout the twentieth century. At the same time that
America’s wars abroad-from the Philippines and Cuba in 1898 to Iraq and Afghanistan-have highlighted “new” and “old” forms of racism, they have also been central to shaping
“common-sense” racial ideologies and projects. This class can be considered a broad cultural history of race and race-making, but our framework means to foreground the
inherence of violence of the story and history of race, both recognizable and hidden. We will be particularly attentive to the uneven distribution and experiences of war and
violence and the ways in which they are racialized and gendered. Given our topic and framework, then, keep in mind that there will be a fair amount of representations of physical
and other kinds of violence in the course materials. Course materials will range from and include literary (selected works by Chester Himes among others) but also scholarly/
theoretical (Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, etc) and cultural/visual (including films, to be determined) texts. This course reflects the aims of Exploring Diversity Initiative by
critically considering the rhetoric of “diversity” that often forgets the very real existence of violence in encounters with difference and otherness.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on active in-class and on-line participation; 2-3 short response papers, in-class presentation and/or workshop; final paper.

Is it true that the U.S. remains the most powerful country in the world due to the combination of noble values that its citizens hold dear? What does “American Freedom” mean at
a time when the U.S. has the highest rate of incarceration in the world? This course is designed to introduce students to different theories of “power” and how it functions in the
contemporary world, using the United States as a case study. Beginning at the domestic level, we will explore how the U.S. has remained relatively politically stable despite deep
racial divisions and polarizations of wealth. Are residents simply satisfied with their lives? Are they intimidated or physically prevented from seeking change? Or is control
maintained in more subtle ways having to do with how we view ourselves and interpret the world? Moving to the international scale, we will analyze whether the United States
should be deemed an empire, ways in which the country’s economic and military influence has been justified, and how its position in the global economy and system of states is
changing. Throughout, we will question how these forms of domestic and international power may be linked. The course will pair challenging theoretical texts with accessible
accounts of historical events and contemporary social processes that exemplify the forms of power under examination. Using texts drawn from history, political science, philosophy, and American Studies, students will develop an understanding of key terms such as class, racial projects, hegemony, governmentality, citizen-subjects, colonialism, the
world-system, and transnational states.

AMST 325(S) Capitalism in Indian Country
Indigenous people are often imagined as somehow outside of capitalism, whether consigned to a distant past, or imagined as living anachronisms in relation to contemporary
capitalism. In this course, we will work against these assumptions, examining the historical development of capitalism in North America in relation to indigenous places and
communities. Through our focus on capitalism in Indian country, we will examine the roots of American property law, wage labor, and large-scale production on Native lands,
and Native peoples who were capitalists in their own right. We will examine the histories of political and economic dependency, and ask questions about how ”development” has
been defined and practiced over Native communities. We will also look closely at the long history of Native land struggles, and links between capital accumulation and ecological destruction. Our economic focus will help us approach the ways the Native peoples have survived colonialism.

The nations and continent of Asia have often figured as sites onto which the U.S. has projected various hopes, anxieties, and desires since the 18th century. Throughout the 20th
century, the rise of U.S. as a global power has been inaugurated and marked perhaps most prominently through its wars in Asia—in the Philippines, Pacific Islands, Korea, Viet
Nam. This class explores how America’s military interventions in Asia have impacted and shaped numerous aspects of American life: how have representations and remembrances of different wars been instrumental in shaping national identities and narratives? How have these wars also been central to our understandings of and discourse about race
in America? And why and how has the work of “culture” been central to wars and vice versa? While the main focus of the class is on the making of American culture, we will
also examine non-U.S. centric texts and critiques and in doing so, our approaches and methods of analyses will seek to be mindful of ways in which certain ideas of “America”—and nationalism—gets privileged.

375, ENGL 375 and LATS 403) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Critics reading minority writing often focus on its thematic—i.e., sociological—content. Such literature is usually presumed to be inseparable from the “identity”/body of the
writer and read as autobiographical, ethnographic, representational, exotic. At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern itself “purely” with formal
questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the critical realm we currently inhabit, in which “race” is opposed to the “avantgarde,” an experimental minority writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by Asian American, African American, Native American
and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-garde writing, genre categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly
young, mostly urban, poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the boundaries of aesthetic form while
simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history. Reading them forces us to re-think our received notions about literature. Authors to be read include Will
Alexander, Sherwin Bitsui, Monica de la Torre, Sesshu Foster, Renee Gladman, Bhanu Kapil, Tan Lin, Tao Lin, Ed Roberson, James Thomas Stevens, Roberto Tejada, and
Edwin Torres.

AMST 403(S) American Music (Senior Seminar in AMST)
One way to write the cultural history of music is to trace the authority with which different people can say “You are hurting my ears.” So writes Carlo Rotella, one of the historians
whose work we will read in this course as we approach American popular music as an object of cultural studies and the new, interdisciplinary field of sound studies. We will study
particular performers and styles (e.g. Elvis, Billie Holiday, punk and hip hop) in the context of the histories of labor; social migration; political and economic shifts; racial
ideologies; and the culture industry. Moving from the late-nineteenth-century to the present, and through agrarian to industrial to postindustrial social configurations, we will
study music and extra-musical noise as a means of expressing resistance and accommodation, as the basis of community-formation and disruption. We will pay special attention
to uses by American musicians and audiences of forms originating outside of American geopolitical borders in the context of global capitalism and American hegemony. Texts
include works of history, cultural criticism, sound culture, and ethnomusicology; audio performance recorded in the field, in the studio, and in concert; and documentary and
fiction films.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a number of written assignments and a final project (option: multimedia).

AMST 405 Home and Belonging: Displacements, Relocations, and Place-Making (Same as LATS 405) (Senior Seminar in AMST) (Not offered
2013-2014) (D) (W)
The metaphor of “home” and idea of “belonging” bring insight to theories and investigations centered on community building and identity formation within and across national
borders. These constructions give us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our objective in this course is to
interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and nations are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed
place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir,
literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in “rooting” migrating
subjects in place and time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American and West Indian festive
forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States,
focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, annotated bibliography, short essay, writing workshop participation (and related assignments), research paper
related assignments, and a final research paper and presentation.

AMST 407 Neoliberalism: A Key Concept for Our Times (Senior Seminar in AMST) (Same as PSCI 307) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Neoliberalism is, in essence, the belief that unencumbered market mechanisms will maximize prosperity and happiness. Over the past thirty years this idea has come to shape the
global economy, the ways governments function, and how individuals understand themselves and their relations with other people in their lives. However, political movements
around the world have challenged these principles — pointing to growing wealth inequality, environmental destruction, and negative cultural changes that have followed the
implementation of neoliberal policies. This interdisciplinary course will provide students with a detailed understanding of the concept and these ongoing debates. We will begin
by tracing the rise of neoliberal thinking in the fields of economics and public policy. We will then explore its impact on American society, relying on sociological accounts of
changes in welfare provision and education, as well as analyses of the political implications of reality television shows. Anthropological studies will help us assess neoliberalism’s effects on the Global South. The course will conclude by looking at political movements resisting neoliberalism and asking whether the current economic crisis marks the
end of this policy agenda and mode of governance.
Format: seminar. Requirements: The course will be run in the style of a graduate seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation, a presentation on reading material, an

AMST 409(F) Sentimental Empire (Senior Seminar in AMST) (Same as ENGL 409) (D)
America’s expansions and interventions throughout its national life have evoked both sentiment and violence. While imperialist ventures themselves—often manifested as acts
of war, although not exclusively—were violent, the cultural logic and rhetoric that accompanied, represented, and remembered them embraced sentimental language and imagery. Our course examines this apparent contradiction of U.S. imperialism to ask whether and how the sentimental has not only masked but also supplemented and enabled
violence of empire. We will also consider how sentiment and violence together function as ways to govern and discipline empire and its subjects. Our scope will include specific
sites and histories (including but not limited to westward expansion, Philippine-American war, Cold War) as well as broader theoretical perspectives and implications through
engagement with contemporary American Studies scholarship on U.S. empire. This class reflects the aims of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by critically reconsidering the
operations of power and management of difference as they have been shaped and enabled by ideology and culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active and consistent in-class participation, 2-3 short response papers, final project.

Edward Said (1935-2003), one of the major critics of the last century, is best known for his groundbreaking 1978 book Orientalism, which inaugurated the field of postcolonial
studies, and for his activist work on behalf of the Palestinian peoples. But his intellectual interests were wide-ranging: from French literary theory to Vico to Middle East politics
to Glenn Gould. A true public intellectual, Said was a rarity among university academics. Besides writing several important scholarly books, he also wrote for various non-academic publications, such as The Nation, Al-Ahram, and The London Review of Books; co-founded, with the musician Daniel Barenboim, the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra; and,
from 1977-1991, served as a member of the Palestinian National Council. In this course, we will focus on works that represent different, though interconnected, facets of Said’s
oeuvre: his more strictly literary critical work (Beginnings and The World, The Text, and the Critic), his work on society and culture (Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism),
his writings on the Palestinian question and the Middle East (The Question of Palestine, Covering Islam, From Oslo to Iraq), his writings on music (Parallels and Paradoxes
co-authored with Daniel Barenboim), and his late work (On Late Style). We will also examine criticism of his work—Orientalism in particular.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields listed below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This
commitment can be revised, in consultation with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a specialization field. In extraordinary
cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own specialization field. All such arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Advisory Committee.

ARTS IN CONTEXT
This specialization is for students interested in American arts, literature and media. Its approaches are interdisciplinary: it trains students to examine cultural artifacts with
attention to aesthetic form and to the contexts—historical, social, political—that determine and situate those forms. Broadly, it asks how history has shaped the arts and media and
how the arts and media have shaped how we think and who we are. Students in this specialization take courses across a range of genres and media: poetry, fiction, music, film and
video, pop culture, visual culture, performance, experimental and activist art.

Students can check with the department coordinator to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN RACE, ETHNICITY, AND DIASPORA
This interdisciplinary specialization examines the role of race, ethnicity, and diasporic movements in the construction of American identities. Students explore how experiences and concepts of race and ethnicity are transformed through the processes of diaspora and immigration. These courses may encompass a broad spectrum of fields such as
history, literature, religion, politics, anthropology, gender studies, media and the performing arts, among others. NOTE: Concentrators in this area are required to take a combination of courses that will allow them to comparatively assess the experiences of at least two ethno-racial groups in the Americas.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor OLGA SHEVCHENKO
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS, FOIAS, JACKALL, JUST, NOLAN. Associate Professor: SHEVCHENKO. Visiting Assistant Professor: RULIKOVA, SEARLE. Lecturer: GUTSCHOW. Affiliated Faculty: GALVIN, HOWE*, MANIGAULT-BRYANT.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an integrated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in
both traditional and modern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as
well as to the cultural complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an examination of the various analytical
schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology’s major subfields: sociocultural anthropology—
that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs—and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology
courses introduce students to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of social institutions and social interaction,
and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understanding
how social reality is constructed.

MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed,
however, to the unity of the social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as well as several elective courses in
common. All joint courses are designated “ANSO.”

Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these are joint (ANSO) courses. We strongly encourage students to take
ANSO 205 and 206 during their sophomore year. The sequences are:
Anthropology
Joint (ANSO)
Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope
SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology
Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO
listings. Two of the courses chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors, students may take some selected courses
from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing towards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and Sociology majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics
and data analysis.

AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies
requirement may be counted toward the major with prior approval of a student’s departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the Area Studies senior seminar, which
cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degree.

LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign language study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and other countries. Because some foreign study
programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must consult
with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to
write an honors thesis should engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal for the thesis for department
approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494,
during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be
awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.

ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An applied exploration of how one makes sense of the social world through fieldwork. Some of the key questions of the course are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and limits of
statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory? How does the social organization

49

of social research affect one’s inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers’ personal biographies and
values shape their work? In the first half of the course, we will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies, drawing upon the field
experiences of departmental faculty and guest speakers from different professional backgrounds. The second half of the course will be dedicated to a hands–on training in field
methods, in which the students will design and undertake their own pilot field projects.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full–participation in the seminar, several short papers, an independent ethnographic project and a final research proposal.
Prerequisites: ANTH 101 or SOC 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).
Not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour:1:10-3:50 W
SHEVCHENKO
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology. The course explores both disciplines’ stances toward the puzzles of tradition and modernity through the works of
major thinkers such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Freud, and others. In particular, the course examines ways in which the two disciplines approach the fundamental problems of
human experience: how do men and women in different societies and epochs construct and maintain social order? How do they allocate authority, responsibility, and blame, as
well as social prestige, power, and material wealth? How do they regulate sexual relationships and organize work? What systems of beliefs and reinforcing symbols do they
fashion to come to grips with evil, misfortune, transgression, and mortality? What epistemological frameworks underpin their worlds? What happens when social worlds fall
apart? The course also reconstructs the intellectual trajectories and social histories of both disciplines.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, class presentations, several short papers.
Prerequisites: ANTH 101 or SOC 101 or ANSO 205 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to Students who are already declared
majors in Anthropology or Sociology.
Not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF
M. F. BROWN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester will be dedicated to the discussion of various current debates and/or
world social issues central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociology. The class will meet with the instructor in the early spring to decide on these topics. In the second
half of the semester, students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. Toward the end of the semester, students will present their projects to the
seminar.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, 10 short response papers, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 15).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF

ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology (D)
Is there such a thing as “human nature”? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This
course addresses these questions by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the course include economics, language
and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers the ways that anthropology, a
discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other societies in search of insights on our own customs and values. Ethnographic
descriptions of both “simple” tribal societies and complex modern ones are a prominent part of the readings. This course explores differences and similarities between cultures
and societies and ways in which they have interacted and responded to one another in the past.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a final examination and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores. Juniors and seniors admitted only by permission of instructor.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR

First Semester: P. JUST
Second Semester: D. EDWARDS

ANTH 103(F) Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology?
Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are found worldwide. This course will present how archaeology reconstructs
the various aspects of human society from the physical record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement patterns, the political and social organization,
and the economy and ideology of prehistoric societies who have left behind mute material records? The objective of anthropological archaeology is to bring to life these
prehistoric cultures through archaeological analysis. The different goals, approaches and methodologies of modern archaeology will be discussed theoretically and then
applied to case studies.
Format: lecture/discussion/class presentations of case studies. Requirements: class presentations, two papers, midterm and final exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF
FOIAS

ANTH 105(F) Introduction to Public and Global Health (Same as INTR 150 and PHLH 150)
Public health focuses on improving health at the level of individuals, communities, or populations. It seeks to understand both individual and collective behaviors that shape
health outcomes in the world today. This class introduces students to core concepts and methods within the fields of public and global health. It investigates the interrelationship
of individual and social choices with demographic and biological factors in producing health outcomes. We look at the pathology and epidemiology of the major diseases and
health disparities in the world today, focusing as much on health equity as on the social and cultural constructions of illness, disease, and health-seeking behaviors. We explore
several case studies to understand the contributing causes of and policy initiatives around the major crises in global health today including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and
maternal mortality. The course involves multiple disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, sociology, economics, biology, bioethics, and political science. By the end of
the semester, we will understand what creates effective public health policy for individuals as well as communities. How does one reconcile the competing moral, social, and
human rights claims in shaping health policies and practices at a variety of levels?
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon participation in class blog, class discussion, one presentation, and final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR

ANTH 207(F) North-American Indians (D) (W)
An introduction to the subsistence strategies, social life, and religious vision of native North Americans. Particular attention will be paid to the sharp differences among Native
American world views and to diverse strategies for cultural survival in contemporary America. Readings will include autobiographical, ethnographic, and historical works, as
well as examples of contemporary Native American literature. This course satisfies the EDI requirement because it assesses a range of indigenous societies and considers the
multiple ways that these societies have responded to the challenge of colonialism and cultural marginalization.
Class format: seminar, with a high level of class participation expected.
Requirements: a midterm, a final exam, and one 15-page research paper.
No prerequisites; open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Priority given to Anthropology and Sociology majors.

ANTH 214(S) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as ENVI 224)
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-gatherer bands to complex urban civilizations. Human prehistory and
history have shown the repeated cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do the similarities and differences in the
development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of societal change, civilization and the state, and human society itself? The course will examine these issues
through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories on the nature, origin,
and development of the state will be reviewed in light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, paper, two quizzes.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF

ANTH 219(F) The Art and Archaeology of Maya Civilization: A Marriage Made in Xibalba (Same as ARTH 209)
The ancient Maya civilization was one of the most sophisticated and complex cultures of prehispanic Central America. Its complex calendrics, astronomy, mathematics and
hieroglyphic writing system are well known worldwide. The course will examine the trajectory and nature of ancient Maya civilization from the combined perspectives of
archaeology and art history. The origins and evolution of the Maya states during the Preclassic period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 250) will be explored by looking at the rich archaeological
evidence and at Preclassic art styles. The Classic Maya civilization (A.D. 250-1000) will then be presented through a detailed survey of the archaeology, art and hieroglyphic
texts of this period. Finally, the collapse of Classic Maya civilization and its transformation and endurance during the Postclassic period and under early Spanish rule (A.D.
1000-1600) will be critically evaluated through a detailed review of the archaeological and iconographic evidence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, hieroglyphic project, research paper.
No prerequisites, but an introductory Art History or Anthropology course recommended. No enrollment limit (expected: 16). Preference: given to Anthropology/Sociology and
Art History majors.

ANTH 222(F) Heroes, Saints and Celebrity (Same as REL 273) (W)
This course examines the ways in which cultures select, ritually celebrate, institutionally harness, and ultimately devour people designated as ’extraordinary’. We will begin by
considering cultural archetypes and theories of the hero and how heroism has been understood in different eras and cultural contexts. Using Weber’s theory of charisma as a
foundation, we will look at a number of specific case studies to evaluate the relationship between individual creativity and action and the demands of social conformity and
control. Finally, we will examine how charisma is commoditized in the form of the celebrity in contemporary American culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, two short response papers, research paper, final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to Anthropology/Sociology majors.

ANTH 225 Visible Culture: Documentary and Nonfiction (Same as ENGL 236) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the written word. We will consider both the theory and practice of
documentary film from its inception around 1900 to the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the representation of social
reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consider include: What is the relationship between written text and image, or between image and
story? What is the role of film in anthropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at film screenings and active class participation. Students will write a 5-page
paper on an assigned topic and a 12- to 15-page final paper. There will be a self-scheduled take-home final.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to Anthropology/Sociology majors, then to sophomores, and finally to first-year students.

No region of the world presents a richer tapestry of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions than Southeast Asia. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are all to be
found and all of them interpenetrate and contend with each other and with a deep undergirding of animism, shamanism, and mystical folk belief systems. This course will survey
these religious traditions through time and space, looking in particular at the growing tension between religion and the state as fundamentalism and religious militancy have
spread into the region in recent times. All of Southeast Asia will be covered, but particular attention will be devoted to Indonesia, where religious blending and the growth of new
fundamentalism are both especially marked.

What does it mean to be a man? This course approaches masculinity in its various forms as a culturally constructed category and as an achieved aspect of social identity. We will
look at characteristics of manhood as they are imagined cross-culturally: man as warrior, lover, husband, father, protector, provider, disciplinarian, abuser; we will look at how
manhood is variously achieved and how it can be lost; and we will look at forms of masculinity as they articulate with modes of sexuality and gender. The course will make
extensive use of cinema in exploring these themes.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance at film screenings, active leading and participation in class discussions, two 7-page papers, final 12-page paper.

ANTH 266T(S) Cultural Evolution (W)
The past decade has seen a revival of Big History in the form of studies of large-scale, persistent patterns in human cultural development. This interdisciplinary tutorial draws on
the insights of Big History by bringing together evolutionary thought and complexity theory to consider the emergence of recognizably human social behavior in the distant past,
the impact of such innovations as language, tool-making, and ritual on human adaptation, and the circumstances that eventually led to the domestication of plants and animals
and the rise of ranked societies and social inequality. Readings will include works by the historian David Christian, the philosopher Daniel Dennett, and the physical anthropologist Barbara King, among others. Questions to be considered in the tutorial include: What is the evolutionary significance of religion? Why did human populations shift from
hunting and gathering to agriculture even though farming is risky and requires much more work? What can complexity theory tell us about the trajectory of human societies as
the global population increases? How plausible is that claim that digital technologies and sophisticated prosthetics are destined to transform us into a posthuman species?
Format: tutorial; each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately 7 double-spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the instructor; students not
presenting an essay have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. Evaluation will be based on weekly essays and critiques.
No prerequisites, but prior exposure to anthropology and evolutionary theory is desirable. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to majors in Anthropology or

This course explores the role of object and place in the creation and perpetuation of national identity. In particular, we will consider the role of monuments, battlefields, museums,
and various ’sacred’ sites in inculcating a sense of shared origins, values, commitments, and ultimate ends. Using a variety of key theoretical texts (including Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities and Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger’s The Invention of Tradition) and maintaining a focus on two countries—Afghanistan and the Czech
Republic—with long and painful histories of foreign invasion and occupation, the EDI course focuses on the ways in which people orient themselves within the symbolic worlds
they inherit and how they negotiate tragedies of circumstance.

ANTH 272 Sex in Society: Cultural Constructions of Reproduction (Same as WGSS 272) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Why is reproduction such a controversial subject in medicine as well as religious and cultural discourses more broadly? And why is the reproductive body subject to such highly
ideological and yet contradictory types of practices across the globe? This course seeks to examine the myriad ways that societies police the range of practices surrounding
reproduction—including fertility, conception, pregnancy, birth, abortion, and motherhood. The class will pursue a comparative analysis of reproduction across major cultures and
religions, as well as a deeper understanding of specialized topics such as the new reproductive technologies, the medicalization and ritualization of obstetrics in America, the
continuing controversies over abortion across the globe, and the fracas over motherhood in the US popularly dubbed the ‘Mommy Wars’. Throughout the course, we remain
focused on the cultural, social, and medical construction of birth and reproduction more generally. To this end, we explore the varying ritual and medical practices that surround
birth in different cultural contexts, from high tech to low tech settings and societies. We will deconstruct the process of human reproduction through readings culled from a variety
of cultures and disciplines including anthropology, medicine, religious studies, sociology, and women’s studies. By the end of the course, we will appreciate how and why
reproduction in such a contentious issue today.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation in a weekly class blog, course presentations, final papers.

ANTH 299(F) Ritual, Power and Transgression (Same as REL 274) (W)
Anthropology began, in part, as an effort to study “savage” cultures before they disappeared under the onslaught of modern civilization, and indeed most of the societies investigated by early anthropologists no longer exist or survive in completely altered form. As they lost their original object of study, however, anthropologists also discovered that the
tools and concepts developed in the study of “primitive” cultures could be applied to the contemporary world. Exploring this possibility, this course examines the relevance of
fundamental anthropological concepts that have developed through the structural and symbolic study of myth and ritual to the contemporary world in which we live.
The course is divided into four sections. In the first unit, we read and discuss the work of Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and Marshall Sahlins on myth and ritual, focusing in
particular on the ways in which different cultures construct categories of inclusion and exclusion, safe and dangerous, pure and impure, while also creating the “in between”
spaces within which both creativity and transgression emerge. On this foundation, we move to the second unit in which we discuss the structural relationship between ritual,
power, and transgression in western contexts, taking the majority of our examples from early modern European and American history. In the third section of the course, we
consider what an anthropological perspective can reveal about some seminal events in 20th century history, and we end the course by considering how anthropological theory
informs two critical areas of current concern: immigration and national security.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, two short response papers, 10-page research paper, final exam.

ANTH 324 Empires of Antiquity (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinating cases are those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different ethnicities, polities and peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important question: how stable have empires been in human
prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political forms? The course will address these questions by examining the major empires of the Old and New World in pre-modern
history: Persian; Assyrian; Mongol; Roman; Chinese; Ottoman; Aztec; and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists, historians, epigraphers, archaeologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the causes of the expansion and collapse of these empires. We will also explore their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms
for their maintenance in order to provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these empires.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly short response papers and a research paper, class presentation and participation.

ANTH 328T(F) Emotions and the Self (D) (W)
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of conceptualizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of recent attempts in the social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the interior experience and an epistemological
framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring the borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring the tools of ethnographic analysis to
bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By examining these phenomena as they occur in other cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend and challenge
the implicit (and often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture, both in daily life and in academic psychological theory. What are
emotions? Are they things—neuro-physiological states—or ideas—sociocultural constructions? How are they to be described; compared? What is the self? How are selves
constructed and constituted? How do various cultures respond to categories of emotion and self, and how can we develop a sense of the relationship between self and emotion?

ANTH 330(F) Materiality and Meaning (Same as ARTH 230) (W)
In this course we will study the things people make and use, from works of art to clothing, buildings, and tools. We will use anthropological theory to explore the social and
communicative roles that objects play in human society and to explain how people use objects to communicate, rebel, exert power, or make sense of the world around them. We
will begin by reconsidering the category ”art” and by exploring the idea that visual practices are culturally constructed. Through reading ethnographic case studies, we will
investigate how meaning and value are produced in different cultural contexts. In particular, we will focus on semiotic theories of value and on theories of exchange, building on
Marcel Mauss’s seminal work The Gift. In the second half of the course, we will attend to the role of material culture in capitalist societies by exploring the processes whereby
things become commodities; by investigating the relationship between style, aesthetics, and class; and by tracing the interrelationships between design, advertising, and consumer society. Readings will include the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Dick Hebdige, Bronislaw Malinowski, Karl Marx, Annette Weiner, and others.

ANTH 334(S) Imagining Joseph (Same as COMP 334, JWST 334 and REL 334) (W)
Beloved son, rival brother, faithful servant, dreamer, seer, object of desire, lover, husband, bureaucrat, the figure of Joseph is one of the most fully-limned and compelling figures
in the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scriptural traditions. The story of Joseph unfolds over fourteen chapters in the Hebrew Bible, and is the subject of the fourth longest sura in
the Qur’an. Through millennia, the story of Joseph has inspired a wealth of interpretations, commentary, apocrypha, re-tellings, and back-story, including an apocryphal book of
scripture about Joseph and his wife, Asenath, Sufi poetry about Joseph and Zuleikha (Potiphar,s wife), a trilogy by the 20th century German novelist Thomas Mann, a musical by
Andrew Lloyd Weber, and many expressions in Western visual art. The course will explore these various expressions, looking to them for the ways in which Joseph has captured
the imaginations of peoples and cultures across time and space. The course will be organized as a collaborative seminar in which the class will read the foundational scriptures
together, followed by thematic discussions to which students will contribute insights from their own readings of particular peripheral texts. Students will learn the pleasures of
close and intense exegetical reading in approaching the Hebrew Bible and Qur’an, as well as the more expansive pleasures of linking post-scriptural expressions together.

middle zones that make cultural creativity possible. Beginning with an examination of “liminality” and rites of passage in the work of Arnold Van Gennep and Victor Turner, we
will go on to look at Mary Douglas’s seminal work on the construction of categories of inclusion and exclusion and other theoretical works on ritual and the sacred. In the course
of the semester, we will consider a variety of cultural contexts in which liminality is of central importance, including transvestitism in traditional Native American and contemporary US cultures, various avant garde artistic movements, and the ritual construction of the suicide bomber/martyr in Islamist practice.

ANTH 340(S) Culture and Capitalism (W)
Capitalism is a set of economic and social arrangements that have transformed human relations across the planet. This course considers classical and contemporary accounts of
capitalism’s main attributes, how it arose, the habits of mind that it promotes, and its tendency to naturalize itself to such an extent that participants come to believe that it
expresses fundamental properties of human nature. Among topics to be addressed in the course are capitalism’s historical roots, its links to religion, its internal contradictions and

52

inherent instability, and the sometimes strange ways that it is perceived by societies when they first come into contact with it. Course readings will include works by Marx, Weber,
Polanyi, Graeber, Harvey, Hayek, Sennett, Taussig, and others.

ANTH 347 Tribe and State on the Afghan-Pakistan Border (Same as ASST 347) (Not offered 2013-2014)
One of the major challenges President Obama will face in his first term in office involves the perilous situation on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While the
problems in the region are generally framed in relation to Islamic extremism, the more fundamental issue is the failure of the Afghan and Pakistani governments to exercise
control over the tribes that occupy the mountainous frontier. This course will look first at the history of the Afghan and Pakistani states and of the Pushtun and Baluchi tribes that
are part of, yet independent from the states that surround them. We will go on to consider the role of Islam as a political force in the region, with particular emphasis on the ways in
which outside religious groups, most recently al-Qaeda, have managed to gain a foothold in the borderlands, despite the historic resistance of the tribes to outsiders of any kind.
The course will also examine the efforts of, first, the Soviet Union in the 1980s and, more recently, the United States and its allies to control the borderlands, and we will conclude
with a consideration of the geopolitical implications if Afghanistan and Pakistan prove in the end to be “failed states.” Readings will include theoretical discussions of tribe/state
relations, British and Soviet era accounts of the frontier (non-fiction and fiction), ethnographies of tribal societies, and contemporary studies.

ANTH 391 Insurgencies: Revolts, Revolutions, Wars of National Liberation, and Jihads (Same as INTR 391) (Not offered 2013-2014)
We often tend to think of warfare in the classic terms described by Clausewitz: states waging armed conflict against other states using uniformed armed forces that are distinct
from non-combatant civilian populations. Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states, colonies, and other political
entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general population and whose objectives are often unlike those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions,
wars of independence or national liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak against the power of the state and may succeed because, to
use Mao’s metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in water. The close relationship between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social
structure, social values, social institutions—in short, the culture—of the society particularly relevant to understanding the nature of a given asymmetric conflict. In this course we
will use theoretical and analytical concepts from anthropology, sociology, history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century and the
present day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the first we will explore some of the theoretical literature on violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature
on tribal and peasant society, peasant revolts, wars of national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be devoted to presentations
prepared by small groups of students on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, the communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of
national liberation such as those in Algeria and Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and “ethnic cleansing” in the Balkans. The final
portion of the course is devoted to an in-depth study of Iraq following the American invasion and to a consideration of the evolving nature of asymmetric conflict in a globalizing
world.

SOC 202(S) Terrorism and National Security
An analysis of the roots, goals, and social organization of contemporary radical Islamist terrorism and of the state efforts to defeat it. A focus on: the recruitment, training, and
indoctrination of Islamist terrorists; their ideologies and self-images; and case studies of specific terrorist attacks and the vulnerabilities of modern societies that such attacks
reveal. The course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic society. Special attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence work; the
investigation of terrorist networks and their financing; the relationship between organized and semi-organized crime and terrorism; the legal dilemmas of surveillance, preemptive custody, and “extraordinary rendition” in democratic societies; and the technology and organization of ascertaining identities in modern society. The course also addresses
the crisis facing European societies—particularly the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany—with growing populations of radical Islamist minorities who reject cultural assimilation into Western social or legal frameworks, a crisis paralleled in the United States, with important differences, by widespread illegal immigration. An assessment of the ideology of multiculturalism and its intended and unintended consequences in the fight against terror. The course also examines the threat of terrorists’
use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media coverage

SOC 216(F) The City
Modern humans have moved to the city, a site with concentrated powers of various kinds, this move has effected irreversible change in human life. We will examine these forces
through readings in urban theories as well as ethnographic studies. We will address themes such as the organization of urban life, the political economy of cities, housing and
homelessness, and urban planning. The city is also the chief site of cultural production and meaning, and our scope of interest will range from studying subcultures, to reading
graffiti, to analyzing monuments. Bearing in mind the inexorable social change of past decades, we will reconsider some classical thought on urban life in the context of post-

53

modern discourse, conceptualize the post-industrial and global city, and conclude with an examination of the problems faced by cities in developing countries.
This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to urban studies. Students will become familiarized with both classical and modern urban theories,
and in reading ethnographies they will have an opportunity to understand some fundamental methodological approaches to the study of the city.

Durkheimian, Marxist, Foucauldian, and Weberian analyses of law and society; as well as the work of those following in the different theoretical schools established by these
scholars. Informed by the theoretical overview, the next part of the course considers empirical research in selected areas of law, including tort law, criminal trial procedures,
abortion and divorce law, “community justice,” and the adjudication of drug offenses. Recognizing that understandings of our own legal practices are enlightened through
comparisons to other legal systems, the second half of the course is primarily historical/comparative in focus. In this section, through an exploration of several case studies,
American legal processes and habits are compared with related legal practices in such places as England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Norway, and Canada.

“This is obvious!” is what we say when we believe our point is irrefutable. But images are far less obvious than we may like to think. This course will create a forum for
discussing the role of images in our lives, as well as the place of the visual in social inquiry. It will explore the variety of ways in which images—and even vision itself— are
shaped by the social and cultural context in which they are embedded, develop skills for critical analysis of existing representations, and address the analytical possibilities and
limitations of the study of signs and images. The course will touch upon a range of visual material, from advertizing to paintings, but the bulk of the course is dedicated to
photography, both as an object of visual analysis and as, increasingly, a research method in social sciences. Topics for discussion include debates around truth in photography and
the politics of representation, changing uses of photography in institutional settings, different photographic cultures and their anthropological and sociological significance, as
well as the use of photography in social research. Primary sources for the discussions will be drawn from a variety of spheres, from Soviet propaganda posters to Balinese identity
photographs, and will include the images we encounter in everyday life, media, politics, academia, “high” art and pop culture.

what we aspire to be—the study of food reveals how societies throughout the world construct difference, whether religious, ethnic, national, or racial. The class will also examine
nutrition, hunger, ideals of desirability in body image, and visual representations of food in advertising and art. Probable readings include: primatologist Richard Wrangham on
how cooking made us human; nutritionist Marion Nestle on food politics; R. Marie Griffith on the Christian diet movement; policy analyst Raj Patel on the global food system;
Psyche A. Williams-Forson on black women, food, and power; journalist Michael Pollan on ethical food choices; philosopher Carolyn Korsmeyer on taste; archaeologist Martin

SOC 268(F) Class and Inequality
This course is designed to explore, both theoretically and empirically, the theme of social structure and inequality in contemporary modern societies. One’s position in social
space largely determines one’s consciousness, identity, values, attitudes, interest, and behavior. While inequality is ubiquitous, there are cross-cultural variations in the definition
of status and consequent distribution of social conditions and opportunities among individuals. In modern societies, social space and individual status are closely interconnected
with the economic system and, consequently, with the occupational structures and relations evolving from it. Currently, globalization and technological developments are rapidly
transforming societies and patterns of inequality. In stable societies, changes in the economic and social sphere are evolutionary in nature. However, these changes come at an
accelerated pace and are typically accompanied by initial chaos and turbulence in societies undergoing major systemic transformation (or even revolution). These societies
provide excellent opportunities to study the relationship of social change and stratification. Therefore, an important focus of this course will also be on the systemic transition
from state socialism to market democracies in Russia and Eastern Europe since 1989.

India’s dramatic rise to global prominence has captured public attention. In newspapers, magazines, and popular books, we read about economic prosperity, growing cities, and
new consumers. In this course, we will investigate the social issues behind these headlines by drawing on sociological accounts of contemporary life in India. Case studies will
provide us with nuanced perspectives on issues such as migration, outsourcing, consumption, and economic development and enable us to re–consider popular and scholarly
characterizations of globalization. As we explore the re–configurations of politics, power, and social life that have occurred since economic liberalization began in the early
1990s, we will tease apart the complex relationships between global economic integration and social change. We will investigate how globalization presents possibilities for
social mobility and political change as well as for exploitation along existing fault lines of inequality and exclusion. Course materials will include ethnographic case studies,
documentary films, commercial films, and items from contemporary Indian media. Lectures will contextualize this material by providing background on Indian society, history,
and politics.

In this course we will investigate how people develop knowledge about the natural and social world. We will follow field biologists, medical students, AIDS activists, physicists,
lab technicians, forest managers, and cartographers as they go about their work in order to understand how social relations and institutions affect the production of knowledge.
Through these case studies, we will explore the ways in which personal relations, values, and power struggles are essential to scientific production rather than peripheral to it.
Knowledge itself –– what we think we know about the world around us –– is socially created. Throughout this course, we will think about what counts as ”knowledge” and
”rationality”; we will question what it means to be ”scientific” or ”objective”; and we will explore how experts become experts. What claims to authority and credibility do they
make? We will examine technologies for representing, categorizing, and theorizing about the natural and social worlds, as well as the effects those technologies have. We will

54

also consider relationships between scientific knowledge, property, and speculative finance. We will conclude the course by analyzing case studies of current scientific controversies chosen by the class.
Format: seminar. Requirements: six 150–word reading responses; two 5–page papers; and a 10–page final research paper completed in stages, including an annotated bibliography and rough draft.

SOC 290T(S) Urban Space, Culture, and Power (D) (W)
This course takes as its starting point the premise that the urban built environment shapes social relations in complex ways. We will tease out the implications of this assertion and
address two central questions with which scholars of urban life have wrestled. First, does city life engender certain kinds of social relationships or forms of personhood? And
second, can one reshape society by changing the physical spaces people inhabit? To answer the first question, we will read classic theories about urban life and compare them to
ethnographic case studies, paying close attention to the question of whether urban living leads to the breakdown of traditional social ties and to the production of ”modern”
rationalities. To answer the second question, we will examine the politics of urban restructuring, studying struggles over urban space to understand different constellations of
power from the colonial era to the globalizing present. We will tease out the ideologies that have underpinned colonial and postcolonial urban projects, and we will examine the
effects of urban redevelopment and residential segregation on urban residents. In the final section of the course, we will focus on the repositioning of cities as sites of capital
investment, global economic integration, and elite consumption in the contemporary era. Throughout the course we will pay close attention to the role of urban space in the
production and reproduction of social inequalities.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: bi–weekly papers, oral presentations, oral and written critiques.

SOC 315(F) Culture, Consumption, and Modernity (W)
How do lifestyles, fashions and trends appear and evolve? Are we authors of our own taste? What structures our choices of goods and activities? What is it that gives meaning to
objects and makes them desirable? Are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? How has globalization changed the ways people consume in different parts of the
globe? This course will explore the consumption and consumer practices as products of modernity and will analyze the political, cultural and social agendas that have transformed consumption over time. Politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and independent consumption choices aggregate into the existing system of global
capitalism) will be treated alongside its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating and articulating identities, building relationships and creating solidarities. It
will look at fashion, advertising, arts, tourism, and shopping in places as varied as nineteenth-century France, socialist Russia, and in contemporary United States, tracing both the
mechanisms that structure patterns of consumption, and the implications that these patterns have for the larger social order.

SOC 317T The Public and the Private (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The sharp distinction between the private and the public spheres is often taken as one of the defining features of the Western modernity itself. Furthermore, the existence and
vibrancy of the public sphere is a crucial precondition for participatory democracy, whereas respect for privacy and provisions and guarantees that ensure personal autonomy
remain fundamental for the daily operations of society. This tutorial course will address the public and the private as concepts that are always in a state of tension, and will explore
these tensions from a sociological and historical vantage point. Topics include: democracy and the public sphere, publicity and its institutions, from the coffee house to the mass
media, individual and collective identities, the “religion of individualism” and its rites and priests, public and private uses of space, the shifting lines of differentiation between the
private and the public and the contestations of this distinction, as well as the impact of new technologies on the relationship between the public and the private. The tutorial will
mainly address the Western cultural tradition, although it will involve intercultural comparisons, drawing on a wide range of literature, from Jurgen Habermas to Svetlana Boym,
Nancy Fraser and Richard Sennett.
Format: tutorial; students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week. Requirements: students will write a 5- to 7- page paper based on the readings every other
week (totaling 5 each); in the alternate weeks they will write and present a 2-page response to their peer’s paper. The evaluation will be based on the analytical qualities of the
students’ written and oral work and on their weekly participation in discussion.

Our sense of self is inextricably tied to our understanding of our past, both as individuals and as members of society. This sense of origins, however, is far from natural; it itself has
its origins in the debates and politics of the time, and evolves under an array of influences. This course analyzes discourses of collective and individual identity and the mechanism involved in the formulation of the individual’s sense of his or her place in the world. Topics include: nations and nationalism, representations of individual and collective
pasts, collective memory and practices of remembrance, nostalgia and selective forgetting, narratives of childhood and a “golden age,” the invention of tradition, museums and
memorials, biography and memoirs, narratives of progression, and the making of national and family histories.

SOC 326(S) Financial Lives (W)
Since the 1970s, the international financial sector has grown dramatically, outpacing its traditional role in facilitating international trade and production. New markets, financial
instruments, and market participants have precipitated growth in the volume of financial flows and in their significance to economies and livelihoods worldwide. In this course,
we will consider the financial system from the point of view of those who operate it. After an overview of the expansion of financial markets since the 1970s, we will investigate
the working lives, practices, and perspectives of those who make markets, with case studies from the US and the UK. We will also consider historical accounts that highlight both
the technological advances and the cultural work that have contributed to the development of the financial system. Considering financial traders as social beings who form
communities, we will investigate how traders build trust, assess risk, forge identities, and create distinction (including along lines of race and gender). We will examine practices
of calculation and speculation and investigate the role of technologies – from paper to mathematical formulae to stock tickers and computers – in shaping those practices. We will
also consider shifting definitions of financial success, failure, and corruption in the history of American finance and how traders have attempted to mold public perception of their
activities. This course draws on and will introduce you to a range of academic traditions concerned with studying economic actors from a socio–cultural perspective, including:
economic sociology, sociology of finance, anthropology, and cultural history.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation and oral presentations, three short papers, and a 10–page research proposal.

SOC 368 Technology and Modern Society (Not offered 2013-2014)
With expanding access to and use of the Internet, controversial developments in such bio-technical practices as the cloning of mammals, rapid advances in various forms of
telecommunication, and the increasing sophistication of technological weaponry in the military, the triumph of technology remains a defining feature of modern life. For the most
part, modern humans remain unflinchingly confident in the possibilities technology holds for continuing to improve the human condition. Indisputably, technology has benefited
human life in innumerable ways. However, as with other features of modernity, technology has also had significant, albeit largely unanticipated, social consequences. Working
within a sociological paradigm, this course will focus on the less often examined latent functions of technology in modern society. It will consider, for example, the social effects
of technology on community life, on privacy, and on how people learn, think, understand the world, communicate, and organize themselves. The course will also examine the
effects of technology on medicine, education, criminal law, and agriculture and will consider such counter-cultural reactions to technology as the Luddite movement in early
nineteenth century England, Amish agrarian practices, and the CSA (community supported agriculture) movement in the contemporary United States.

SOC 385(F) (formerly ANSO 402) The Foundations of American Society
An examination of the social, cultural, epistemological, and moral foundations of contemporary American society. This seminar will pay special attention to the: economic and
social consequences of the de-industrialization and concomitant globalization of the American economy and America’s new debtor-nation status; social and cultural effects of
ongoing massive immigration, legal and illegal; increasing bureaucratization of every sphere of life, especially the growth of the leviathan state apparatus; proliferation of claims
on public and private bureaucracies fueled by adroit and competing advocacy; clashes between the manifold cultural frameworks that give meaning to personal experiences;
institutionalization of adversary political cultures, on both the left and right; entrenchment of centrifugal ideologies of multiculturalism and diversity; polarization of our elites and
stalemating of America’s political system; and the remarkable multiplicity of moral codes that often conflict with presumably common laws. In all, the course addresses a crucial
question: who are we now as a nation? It proceeds entirely through discussion and student presentations of lively contemporary materials. Students are expected to have read
certain classical sociological and political texts before the class begins.

SOC 387 Propaganda (Not offered 2013-2014)
A sociological analysis of the phenomenon of mass persuasion in modern society. The course will examine the institutional and technical apparatus of modern propaganda and
the role of intellectuals and technicians in shaping and disseminating propaganda. The symbolic content of specific kinds of propaganda—political, commercial, social, and
organizational—will be considered with attention to propaganda that seeks to overthrow social structures as well as maintain them. The course will proceed through a series of
intensive case studies with a particular focus on propagandists themselves, considered as experts with symbols, and on the institutional milieux in which they work. Among other
examples, we will examine the U.S. Committee on Public Information during the First World War; the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda; the propaganda machinery in contemporary
states and non-state actors of both the left and right; conservative and liberal “public interest” groups; propaganda in contemporary social movements and national political
campaigns; the workings of corporate and university personnel offices; and advertising and public relations agencies in the United States. Throughout the course, we will analyze
how the language, ideologies, and visual symbols of particular varieties of propaganda seem to affect mass audiences.

Students who place into more advanced language courses may substitute additional courses for 101-102, but they must still take a total of nine courses.
Up to four courses from approved study abroad programs may be counted toward the major.

The Certificate in Arabic
The Certificate in Arabic demonstrates that a student has acquired a working foundation in the language. The sequence of eight language and culture courses is
designed to supplement a student’s major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowledge in a related field.
Required Courses
ARAB 101
ARAB 102
ARAB 201
ARAB 202
ARAB 301
ARAB 302
Electives
-at least one course in Arabic literature, arts, or culture
-at least one course in Arabic history, religion, politics, or economics
Students must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher in the sequence of eight courses. In addition, they must receive a score of at least 85% on a language proficiency
test administered by the Arabic faculty. The test is administered once a year during the month of April to all students who wish to obtain the Certificate. Those interested should
express their intent to the Arabic faculty by March 1st or earlier.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Arabic may be exempted from up to three of the required eight courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate, a student
must take no fewer than five courses (including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.

The Degree with Honors in Arabic Studies
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Arabic are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal. In addition, candidates must demonstrate a
strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Arabic are strongly urged to secure an advisor by the end of the week after Spring Break in their junior year. By May 15th of their junior
year, candidates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. The Advisory Committee will inform candidates
by June 1 whether they may proceed with the thesis and advise them about any changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the project. The summer before the senior
year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and preparing for the process of writing the thesis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses (ARAB 493-W31-ARAB 494). By the end of the Fall semester, students will
normally have undertaken substantial research and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. At this point students should also have a clear sense of the work
remaining for completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students will also have chosen and met with a second reader for the project, who will provide additional
guidance and read the final thesis. By the end of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire project. At that time, the Comparative Literature Advisory
Committee, together with the advisor, will determine whether the project may continue as an Honors Thesis, or whether its first portions (ARAB 493-W) will be graded as
Independent Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due one week before the last day of classes. At
the end of the Spring term, the student will make a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee will be specially invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must have to do with some aspect of Arabic language, culture, history, politics, etc. and will be worked out between the thesis writer and her/his advisor. It
is also possible to write a thesis that consists of an original translation of a significant text or texts; in this case, a theoretical apparatus must accompany the translation. The
complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, excluding the bibliography.
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (ARAB 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee will determine whether a candidate will receive Honors, Highest Honors,
or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including the thesis course (ARAB 493-W-494)-is 10, i.e., one of the thesis courses
may substitute for one elective.

ARAB 101(F)-W-102(S) Elementary Arabic
This is a year-long course in which students will learn to read, write and converse in Arabic while becoming familiar with the basic grammar of Modern Standard Arabic. This is
a communicative-oriented course which revolves around the daily practice of vocabulary, conversation and different grammatical structures in class. You will be expected to
speak Modern Standard Arabic in class from an early stage. Students will also be expected to take advantage of the technological resources available for the study of Arabic on
the internet, as well as the technological aids available as part of our textbooks for this course, Alif Baa and Al-Kitaab fii Ta’allum al-’Arabiyya from Georgetown University
Press.
Format: lectures, five hours a week. Evaluation is based on tests, daily homework, and active class participation.

ARAB 216 Protest Literature: Arab Writing Across Three Continents (Same as COMP 216) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will begin with an analysis of the idea of protest literature as it emerged in an American cultural context in the early twentieth century through the civil rights
movement of the 1960s. We will then seek to revisit the meaning of this term today, particularly as it resonates in the cultural production of Arabs and Arab youth across three
very different locations: the Middle East (specifically Egypt and Palestine), France, and the United States. How are these Arab youth subcultures constituted? In what ways has
the globalization of hip-hop influenced the literary, musical, and cinematic production of Arab artists? In what way do rap and the spoken word in these specific social contexts
provide a vocabulary for expressing the violence, lack, and frustration pervasive in these 4th World locations? In short, how has the contemporary American construction of
“blackness” been exported and appropriated by young Arabs today? From Paris to Cairo, from the West Bank to Detroit, we will examine the varied strands of this new movement for social justice, observing how different forms of literature and music have been used as a vehicle for resisting war-torn circumstances, poverty, racism and social disenfranchisement across diverse national spaces. Texts for this course will include novels and poems, as well as a number of films and selections of music. All of these works will be
available in translation, although advanced students may read the originals in French and/or Arabic. Possible novels include those of Charef, Sebbar, Smail, Begag, Chraibi,
Ayaidi, Golayyel, Latif, Kanafani, Darwish, Youssef, Hammad, and Kahf.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation, two shorter papers, a presentation, and final paper or project.

ARAB 219 Arabs in America: A Survey (Same as AMST 219 and COMP 219) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Arabs have been a part of the tapestry of the United States since the early 19th century. As immigrants to the new world, the identity of this community has largely been defined
by changing American understandings of race, ethnicity, and religion. The in-betweenness of this minority group—not exactly white or black, claiming Christian, Jewish and
Muslim faiths—and the often contradictory nature of U.S. involvement in the region, has only further confounded Americans in their understanding of this diverse community.
This course will use an interdisciplinary approach to explore the rich histories, representations, and cultural production of this American minority group. For the purposes of this
survey, we will also consider the narratives of other Muslim minority groups (i.e., Iranians, Pakistanis, Indians, and African American Muslims) within the scope of the Arab
American experience. We will look at poems and stories from Arab immigrants in the early to mid 20th century (e.g., the Mahjar poets) and consider, in the context of these
writings, issues of xenophobia, assimilation, linguistic, and cultural difference, and Arab American identity in the context of other ethnic groups. Throughout this course we will
continue to think about how changing U.S. geo-political interests in the region alter perceptions of Arabs and Muslims in our midst (considering, for example, the 1979 Revolution in Iran and the subsequent hostage crisis, the two Gulf Wars, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, 9/11, Afghanistan, the War on Terror, and Guantanamo). In addition, we will
examine representations of this minority and Islam more generally in the media and popular culture (print and broadcast journalism, films, cartoons, popular songs, and videos),
as well as Arab cultural forms that seek to self-narrate the Arab experience for an American viewer. At the heart of this course is a desire to not only shed light on what it means to
be an Arab or a Muslim or an immigrant, but also to understand the multiple ways in which we conceptualize and seek to define what it means to be American.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, two shorter papers, occasional responses, a presentation, and a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference given to Arabic Studies Majors, Comparative Literature and Literary Studies Majors, and American Studies
Majors.

ARAB 223 Migrants at the Borders: Comparative Middle Eastern and Latin American Cultural Studies (Same as COMP 223) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Why do the peoples and cultures of Latin America and the Middle East often elicit such passionate responses in the United States and Europe? Some feel threatened, while others
are intrigued, but responses to these world regions are seldom neutral. Often seen as exotic and erotic, or as a danger to the way of life of Americans and Europeans, Islam, Arabs
and Latin Americans are at the forefront of socio-political debates in the United States and Europe. The origins of this world-view are historical, but are also heavily influenced by
contemporary immigration and international affairs. After characterizing Islam as the greatest contemporary threat to “Western” civilization in his infamous essay titled “The
Clash of Civilizations,” Samuel Huntington subsequently found it necessary to focus on Latinos as the most significant threat to American civilization. By examining literature
and film from the Middle East and Latin America, and from these immigrant communities in the United States and Europe, we will go beyond superficial images and inflammatory rhetoric to explore the cultures behind the passions. Among other things, the texts of this course examine the ties between the Arab world and Latin America, and between
these two regions and their neighbors to the north. At the heart of this course are the ideas of borders and margins. What does it mean to cross borders or to live on the margins of
society? The borders we will discuss will be geographic borders, but also cultural borders that will permit the exploration of the territories between life and death, civilization and
barbarism, wealth and poverty, war and peace and other dichotomies that some employ to classify the world but that rarely allow for human sensibilities and the subtle experiences of being. Our texts may include works by writers such as Alurista, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Gloria Anzaldua, Juan Rulfo, Clarice Lispector, Milton Hatoum, Taher Ben
Jelloun, Mohamad Choukri, Mahmoud Darwish, Laila Lalami and Tayyib Saleh that treat the human condition at the borders/margins of society. Films may include El Norte, La
Mision, Pixote, Midaq Alley, City of God, Battle of Algiers, My Beautiful Launderette, Crash, Hate and Head On. There will also be a course reader that includes theoretical
material on orientalism, tropicalism, nationalism and transnationalism. All readings are in English translation and films have English subtitles.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, two 3- to 5-page papers and a final research paper (7-10 pages) or half hour oral exam.
No prerequisites: Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20).

ARAB 228(F) Modern Arabic Literature in Translation (Same as COMP 228) (D) (W)
In this course we will study prominent texts and authors of the modern Arab world. The range of genres and themes of this literature is vast. In particular, we will analyze the
debates around modernity and the importance given to social engagement in these texts. Our readings include works by authors that have received some notoriety outside of the
Arab world such as Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1988. We will also read the Iraqi poets Nazik al-Malaika and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, the

58

Palestinians Ghassan Kanafani and Mahmoud Darwish, and Tayyib Salih from the Sudan. Included in our readings are the famous autobiography by the Moroccan Muhammad
Shukri as well as women’s literature by Hanan al-Sheikh, Huda Barakat and Nawal Sadawi. This literature course fulfils the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative
(EDI), as it engages the Arab world from a humanistic perspective that aims to promote cultural awareness. A fundamental goal of the course is to engage the diversity of
approaches to sexuality, religion, gender and politics that are so prominent in contemporary literature from the Arab world. All readings are in English.
Format: lecture/discussion.
Requirements: active and consistent class participation, two short paper (3-5 pages) and a final paper (5-7 pages).

ARAB 233 Introduction to Classical Arabic Literature (Same as COMP 233) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this course we will examine the rich, complex and diverse texts of Classical Arabic Literature. The readings include works that have achieved notoriety outside of the Arab
world (such as the Quran and One Thousand and One Nights) as well as works by authors largely unknown outside of the Arab world but canonical in Arabic-language culture
such as Imru al-Qays, al-Jahiz, al-Ma’arri, Abu Nuwas, al-Hallaj, al-Ghazali and al-Mutannabi. Women’s literature in this course includes works by al-Khansa’, known for her
elegies, and by Wallada bint al-Mustakfi of Cordoba, who contributed to the courtly love poetry of both Europe and the Arab world. Topics for discussion include theological and
philosophical queries, erotica, wine, bibliomania and avarice. Our primary texts represent such varied regions as the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Abbasid Baghdad, North Africa
and Islamic Spain. Chronologically, the texts range from the sixth century CE to the fourteenth century. All readings are in English.

ARAB 245(S) Revolution in Arab Cinema (Same as COMP 245)
This course examines the cinematic portrayal of revolution, civil war, and nationalist struggles in the Middle East. We will look at how Arab directors have interpreted liberation
struggles and nationalist revolutions to include broader cinematic discourses on culture, gender, social conflict, and national identity. In addition, we will consider whether Arab
films wrestling with recent history may be viewed as harbingers of the upheaval and optimism brought on by the Arab Spring. In covering such rich ground, this course seeks to
provide students with a critical introduction to the language of film while presenting a social and historical context to the major conflicts in the region in the past half-century. We
will cover feature film production, documentaries, short films, and digital media. While students will view films from across the region, special emphasis will be given to films
pertaining to the Egyptian Revolution. Filmmakers include Yousry Nasrallah, Ibrahim El Batout (Egypt); Moufida Tlatli (Tunisia); Ziad Douerie and Nadine Labaki (Lebanon);
Elia Sulieman and Michel Khaleifi (Palestine). The course will highlight many of the amateur digital videos that have been instrumental in exposing both the brutalities of the
repressive regimes and the triumphs of the mass mobilizations against them. Class will be conducted in English.
Format: lecture. Requirements: Active class participation, weekly readings in film criticism, a few film reviews and short reading responses, one presentation, a midterm, and a

ARAB 251(F) Popular Culture in the Arab World: Youth, Populism, and Politics (Same as COMP 251)
Since the uprisings in the Arab world in 2011, much attention has been paid to the significant role of the “popular“ in creating social and political transformations. The voice of the
youth and “the street,” in particular, emerged as massive sources and sites for political mobilization. But, are these categories identical? Does youth culture equal popular culture?
This survey course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the different layers that constitute popular culture in the Arab world since the decolonization of Arab
states in the 1950s. Questions that we will ask include: What constitutes “popular culture” in the Arab world? How is it different than folk culture, mass culture, or “high” culture?
Who are the key players in the creation and dissemination of “popular” culture? Besides globalization, for example, what other social, political and economic dynamics engulf
the definition of the “popular”? What are modes of self-fashioning and representation of Arab identity that characterize this culture? To answer these questions we will watch
several documentaries about music, politics and youth in the Arab world. We will also read a selection of essays from anthropology, Arab culture studies, political science, and
journalism to provide historical and critical context for the material discussed in class. Required graphic texts include NajiAl-Ali’s A Child in Palestine and Majdi Shafi’s Metro:
A Story of Cairo.

ARAB 252 Arab Women Memoirs: Writing Feminist History (Same as COMP 252, HIST 309 and WGSS 251) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course reviews selected autobiographical writings by Arab women writers from the wave of independence in the 20th century to the contemporary Arab uprisings, passing
by all the transformations that globalization and the technosphere have instigated. We will examine the role that first-voice narrative plays in shaping literature, history and
thought, while providing a space to reclaim cultural, social and political agency. Focusing on the different articulations of self-representation, our discussion will address how
these women reflect on the shifting discourses of identities, gender, nationalism, religion, feminism, sexuality, politics, borders and their histories. Questions we will address
include: How did these memoirs contribute to the development of Arab feminist consciousness? In addition to the memoirs, we will look at women blogs and watch films which
focus on first-person narrative to discuss related topics, such as, visual testimonies, virtual political participation, and feminist resistance in the technosphere. There will also be a
course reader that includes critical essays and selections from autobiographical writings that reflect the diversity of Arab women in the Middle East and the diaspora. Required
texts include: Fadwa Tuqan’s A Mountainous Journey: An Autobiography, Nawal El Saadawi’s Memoirs from the Women’s Prison, Fatima Mernissi’s Dreams of Trespass: Tales
of a Harem Girlhood, Leila Ahmed’s A Border Passage: From Cairo to America—Woman’s Journey, Fadia Faqir and Shirley Eber’s In the House of Silence: Autobiographical

ARAB 257 Baghdad (Same as COMP 257) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Some consider Baghdad to be a specter of civil-war Beirut, but behind the deluge of grim news is a rich, complex heritage. Baghdad has a long history as an intellectual milieu,
literary setting and muse. This city became a major cultural center when the Islamic Caliphate was moved there in the eighth century CE. The multiplicity of intellectual and
artistic currents that flourished in Baghdad under the Abbasids would produce one of the earliest modernizing movements in poetry, a challenge to the early Islamic tradition, a
wealth of translation activity and a general cultural vibrancy in a multicultural, multilingual context. The texts of the Golden Age of Baghdad would become fundamental to the
Arab and Islamic cultural heritage while the city itself would continue to exert a strong creative influence in both the Middle Eastern and European artistic traditions. This
influence continues to this day as Arabs and Muslims look to Baghdad as a fundamental part of their cultural heritage while Westerners continue to be intrigued and haunted by
this city. In this course we will read early texts written in or about Baghdad including examples from 1,001 Nights and from works written by al-Ma’arri, al-Mutanabbi, Abu
Nuwas, al-Ghazali and al-Hallaj. We will also read more recent texts that engage this city including works by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Buthaina Al Nasiri. In addition to these
texts, we will also view films including Sindbad movies, The Thief of Baghdad and Aladdin. The texts for this course include examples from both “high” and popular culture.
These works are by both natives of Baghdad and by outsiders including the producers of Hollywood orientalist fantasies.
Requirements: active class participation, two short-answer quizzes, two 4- to 6-page papers and a final 6- to 8-page paper.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

ARAB 262 Outlaws and Underworlds: Arabic Literature of the Margins (Same as COMP 262) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The idea of the rogue or the outlaw is a theme that may be traced in Arabic literature from the classical poetry of the pre-Islamic period through to the present. In considering a
range of works from the 6th century onward, this course will explore the way in which the outlaw has historically been used as a literary motif in Arabic literature to reflect and
critique, not just society, but the official literary establishment as well. How does a writer’s language—the decision to write in the vernacular, for example—serve as a way of

59

flouting the cultural establishment in an effort to speak to a more popular audience? In examining characters who live by thievery or begging—who embrace the ethos of
outsiderness—we will return repeatedly to consider the concept of freedom as a driving question in these works. Between conformity and deviance, decadence and lack, how do
we define what makes a person truly free? The rich underworlds that these outlaws inhabit are sketched for readers as counter-cultures whose alternative way of life and set of
values continually challenges the conventions and mores of the mainstream. Readings will include selections from early Arabic (Suluk) poems, Abu Nuwas’ wine poetry, the
maqamat tradition of rhymed prose, as well as a number of contemporary Arabic novels.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, multiple reading responses, two short papers (5-7 pages) including revisions, and one longer paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

ARAB 353 Writing the City: Beirut and Cairo in Contemporary Arabic Literature (Same as COMP 353) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury has written that understanding contemporary Lebanese literature requires us to understand “how literature both creates myth and then seeks
to destroy it.” This class will consider this statement in relation to the development of the Arabic novel emerging out of Beirut and Cairo in the latter part of the twentieth century.
We will consider the ways in which Lebanese and Egyptian novelists use the motif of the city as a way to take up the prevailing social and political issues of the day. In so doing
we will discuss how some works actively mythologize and celebrate the city as an extension of national identity, while others portray it as the root cause of the country’s social
ills. We will also consider how the history of each of these cities was intertwined with the rise and fall of certain ideological movements in the Arab world whereby the novel, as a
relatively new form in the region, served as an alternative medium for theorizing and considering the efficacy of such movements. In taking up these questions, we will discuss
the extent to which the trajectory of the Arabic novel may be understood as a reflection of the changes affecting these urban milieus and reciprocally the way these two cities are,
and continue to be, produced by these fictions. Throughout the semester we will read a range of works by Lebanese and Egyptian novelists as well as a selection of critical
material that theorizes the city in relation to literature.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation, presentation, two short papers (5-6 pages), and one longer paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference given to Comparative Literature majors and seniors.

The Department offers students different paths to explore the vital connection between visuality and creativity. With courses of study in the History of Art and
the Practice of Studio Art (or a combination of History and Practice), the Major is designed to train students to develop the technical, conceptual, critical, and
historical tools they need to engage the visual world.
ADVISING
Students are expected to discuss their choice of courses and path through the major with a professor in the department. The official advisors for each route
through the major are listed here below, and any questions concerning curriculum or requirements should be directed to one of them.
Art History Faculty Advisor: Mark Haxthausen
Art Studio Faculty Advisor: Ed Epping (Fall), Michael Glier (Spring)
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ben Benedict, E. J. Johnson, Elizabeth McGowan, Michael Lewis
ART HISTORY
The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present
and yet documents of the past. We emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual literacy. In addition
to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the Art History major increases one’s ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
Major Requirements
Any two of the following three foundational courses, ArtH 101, 102, or 103
Any 100-level studio class without prerequisites (preferably taken by the end of the junior year)
Any three courses in art history concerned, respectively, with each of the following:
1) a period of art prior to 1800
2) a period of art prior to 1400
3) art of the Middle East, Asia, or Africa
ArtH 301: Art About Art: 1400–2000 (must be taken by the end of the junior year)
One 400-level Seminar or 500-level Graduate Seminar
Any additional course at the 300, 400, or 500 level

The faculty encourages students to construct a major with historical depth and cultural breadth. The numbered sequence of courses is intended to develop
knowledge and skills appropriate to students’ level of experience, ultimately supporting original, independent work at the 400-level.
100-LEVEL COURSES require no experience in the subject. They are introductions to the field that develop students’ skills in visual analysis, interpretation,
and written expression and argumentation.
200-LEVEL COURSES are introductions to specific fields within art history. Often, there is a significant lecture component to the courses.
300-LEVEL COURSES focus more closely on specific art-historical problems, or present material in a tutorial format. The goal of these courses is to build
skills needed for independent research and sustained analytical writing. Generally, there is a higher expectation of student participation or initiative, and longer
and/or more frequent writing assignments. In the 300 level, students learn to work with and evaluate different types of sources, research tools, historical perspectives, and methodological approaches.
400-LEVEL COURSES courses are intensive discussion-oriented seminars that emphasize critical analysis and build toward student-initiated, independent
work (oral presentations and sustained, analytical research papers). Advanced majors who have taken ArtH 301 are encouraged to work at the 400 or 500
level, and papers produced in these courses are normally the basis for the senior thesis.
ART STUDIO
The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a critical understanding of making art to support creative interests, and to
develop students’ perceptions and imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media.
Major Requirements
ArtS 100: Drawing I
One art history course (preferably taken by the end of the junior year)
Three courses in three different media (ArtS 100 and tutorials do not satisfy this requirement)
One elected ArtS course
ArtS 319: Junior Seminar
Any two of the 300-level ArtS courses
or
One 300-level ArtS course and ArtS 418T: Senior Tutorial

Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduction to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of visual expression. An art history course provides part of the necessary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn
the elements of some of the principal visual arts media: for example, architecture, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. These courses
combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the development of the student’s individual vision.
All students taking ArtS418 are required to exhibit in the spring of their senior year at the Williams College Museum of Art or other appropriate venues. Students who choose to take two 300-level classes do not exhibit at WCMA in the spring of the senior year.
HISTORY AND PRACTICE
This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study
that emphasize particular media, themes, or methodological issues. Students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as
the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. (Note that the Art History and Studio Art Practice routes are strongly recommended for any prospective
Art major who is contemplating graduate study in Art History or Art Studio.)

61

Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls between the two. In these cases, it is better for the
student to choose between history and studio-taking additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the department.
History and Practice students, who are admitted to the Senior Tutorial, will participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The student must first submit a written application for the
major. The application must include a thoughtful statement of the theme of the major that both 1) shows the coherence and integrity of the plan of study and
2) explains why the students’ goals cannot be met in either history or studio. The application must include both the written statement and a list of proposed
courses. The application must be submitted in two copies to advisors in both wings of the department. If approved, the application and list of proposed courses
must be submitted to the department secretary before registering for the major.
Major Requirements
ArtH 101-102: Aspects of Western Art
ArtS 100: Drawing I
One 200-level ArtS course
ArtH 301: Art About Art: 1400–2000 or ArtS 319: Junior Seminar
One ArtH seminar (400-level) or one 500-level graduate course except 508
One 300-level ArtS course or (with permission) ArtS 418T: Senior Tutorial
Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art
History course concerned with a period of art prior to 1800 (either of Europe, North America, and South America OR art of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa).

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of superior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History
To graduate with honors in art history, students are to enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar (ArtH 494) during the Spring semester of their senior year, where they will develop
an original research paper (completed in a prior course or an independent study). To be admitted to the seminar, students must submit their original research paper to the Art
Department’s Administrative Assistant in Spencer no later than the end of the exam period of the Fall semester. The paper must be properly formatted and include both illustrations and bibliography. It must additionally include an abstract of not more than 250 words.
Students must also secure an academic advisor for their project and complete the advising Agreement Form (available from the Art Department’s Administrative Assistant) by
the end of the exam period of the Fall semester. This form serves to verify: a) your advisor’s support of your project, and b) your advisor’s approval of your plans for Winter Study.
Students should plan to dedicate Winter Study to work on their thesis project and, to this end, they should enroll in ArtH 31 immediately after (but not before) notification of
admission into ArtH 494. (To avoid problems should they not be admitted to ArtH 494, students should pre-register in another Winter Study course). Because faculty are not
usually available during this period, it is very important for students to plan, together with their advisors, a work schedule for Winter Study with concrete goals.
Admission to the Senior Honors Seminar will be determined by the instructor of the seminar, in consultation with the Art Department faculty. The important criteria for admission
are: 1) the quality, originality, and potential of the research paper on which the thesis project will be based; 2) the availability of a suitable advisor for the project, and the commitment of that advisor to supervise the work during the Spring term; 3) strong past performance in the art history route to the Major; 4) completion of ArtH 301 by the time of the
application (exceptions to this rule must be granted beforehand by the chair of the Department).
In early January, the instructor will notify students of their admission to the Honors Seminar. Since enrollment is by invitation only, students should pre-register for four classes
in the Spring semester. If invited to join the seminar, students should then drop one of those courses and add the Honors Seminar during drop-add period. The Honors Seminar is
to be taken in addition to the nine required courses for the art history route to the Major. Once in the seminar, students will revise, refine, and expand on previous research and
produce a paper of approximately 25 pages. At the end of the semester, they will present a shortened version of the paper to the faculty and public at the Williams College
Museum of Art.
Art Studio
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to take an extra studio course, of their choosing, for a total of ten courses. One of the ten courses
must be the 400-level Senior Tutorial (ArtS 418T). Students must also take the Honors Independent Study course (ARTS 31) during Winter Study of their senior year. Studio
faculty will provide feedback on the progress of the honors project at the beginning of the Spring semester.
Honors candidates enrolled in the Senior Tutorial must demonstrate prior experience in the media chosen for the honors work. This proof may consist of one or more 200-level
courses in the medium, course work at the 300 level, and/or a portfolio demonstrating the student’s proficiency in the media chosen for the honors project. This work must be
presented to the instructor of the Senior Tutorial at the start of the Spring semester. At the end of the Spring semester of senior year, honors candidates will orally defend their
work in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend each defense. Based on the work and the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate
honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice
The route to honors is a combination of the art studio and art history routes to honors. At the beginning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a
proposal to two faculty members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the candidate enrolls in an independent
study and works through the Fall semester and Winter Study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of Winter Study; if the project is not well enough
developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls either in Senior Tutorial (ArtS 418T, for which they will need
permission of the instructor), if the project is primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is submitted
to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.
STUDY ABROAD
The Art Department encourages students to travel and study abroad. Students must take into consideration, however, that required courses for juniors in each wing, ArtH 301
and ArtS 319, prepare students for the independent research and/or independent artistic production which is the focus of the senior year.
a. Art History students must take ArtH 301 in their junior year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case, they may take the required class in their
senior year (and should consider taking the course as a second-semester sophomore).
b. Studio Art Majors must take the required Junior Seminar (ArtS 319) in the Fall semester of their junior year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year; or
unless they have permission of the chair of the department, in that case, they may take the required class in their senior year.
c. History and Practice students must include their Study Abroad plans in their application to the major and discuss them with their advisor.
Note: Credit for study abroad courses toward the Major in Art Studio is not automatic. A portfolio of completed work, or documentation (such as photographs) of the work if the
original work is not portable, must be submitted to art studio faculty upon return from study abroad. (The student should consult the Art Studio advisor to determine which Art
Studio faculty will assess the portfolio). The work submitted from a study abroad course must be deemed roughly equivalent in quantity and quality to course work at the College
in order for a study abroad course to count towards the Art Studio Major.

ART HISTORY COURSES
ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Aspects of Western Art
A year-long introduction to a history of some European and North American art, this course concentrates on three-dimensional media in the fall (ArtH 101- architecture and
sculpture) and two-dimensional media in the spring (ArtH 102- painting, drawing, prints and photography). Even though the course focuses on Western art, it also explores
interchanges among other cultures and the west, particularly in more recent times. Both semesters cover the same chronological span, from Ancient Greeks to computer geeks.
We organize the course in this unusual way not only to give students the grasp of history, but also to heighten their ability to understand visual objects by coming to grips with only
one artistic medium at a time. To train students to look carefully at art, we use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the Williams College Museum
of Art and the Chapin Rare Book Library.
Students spend time with original works of art. For the study of architecture we have a unique set of “Virtual Buildings” made expressly for this course, that approximate the
experience of being in structures thousands of miles away.
Format: lecture and weekly discussion section. Requirements: quizzes, midterm, two papers and a final exam.
ARTH 101-102 may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; however, the course may be audited. Students who have audited ARTH 101-102 lectures on a registered basis may enroll in
any Art History course at the 200 or 300 level. Although students may begin the course in either the fall or spring semester, both semesters of ARTH 101-102, a hyphenated

62

course, must be taken to receive course credit for either semester. The only exception is for art history majors who may take ARTH 103 in place of either 101 or 102. Students
should petition the chair of the Department for this exception to be made.
Enrollment limit: 180 (expected: 180). Open to first-year students.

ARTH 103(F) Asian Art Survey: From the Land of the Buddha to the World of the Geisha (Same as ASST 103) (D)
This course introduces to students some of the major monuments of Asian art with an emphasis on the art of India, China, and Japan. Its contextual approach helps students gain
insight into the aesthetic, religious, and political ideas and cultural meanings conveyed by the works of art. Visual analyses and thematic discussions will bear upon the interconnectedness among these three cultures, and their respective interactions with the West. This course also provides students with the vocabulary, techniques, and patterns of thinking needed for advanced art history courses.
Highlights include sexual symbolism in Hindu and Buddhist art; nature or landscape painting as moral and political rhetoric; the relationship between words and images; the sex
industry and kabuki theater and their art in Edo Japan; and the meeting of the East and West. This course is one of the three foundational courses; art history majors may choose
any two of the three courses ARTH 101, ARTH 102, and ARTH 103 to fulfill the foundational requirements.
As an EDI course, its historical, visual, and thematic analyses will bear upon the interconnectedness not only among these three distinctive different cultures, but their respective
interactions with the West.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on three 30- to 40-minute quizzes, two short papers, film screening and class attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35. Highly recommended for first-year students. May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

ARTH 212(S) Distant Encounters: East Meets West in the Art of the European Middle Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences—in architecture, manuscript illumination, mosaic, sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and other minor
arts—of European contact with the Eastern Mediterranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long
journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam
in the seventh century, Europeans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from nonChristians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser “crusades.” Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples,
ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and
Venice. The course aims to survey artistic production within each of these different contexts of East-West encounter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.

ARTH 213 Greek Art and Myth (Same as CLAS 213) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Classical myth provides rich subject matter for painters and sculptors throughout the history of western art. This course investigates the earliest representation of myth in Greek
art of the seventh through the first centuries B.C.E. Sophisticated narratives involving gods and heroes first appear in a variety forms and contexts. Myth informs the visual culture
of the Greeks on many levels, from paintings on vases used in domestic contexts to the marble sculpture that decorated the monumental temples of great sanctuaries throughout
the Greek world. The purpose of the course is two-fold: to familiarize students with the subjects and narratives of Greek myths and the underlying belief system that, in part,
produced them, and also provide a comprehensive outline of developments in Greek art in the first millenium B.C.E. Of special interest will be the techniques developed by
artists for representing narratives visually, as well as the conceptual issues that underlie certain myths, such as sacrifice, war, marriage, coming of age, specific festivals, and the
relationships between men and women, and those between mortals and immortals. Reading will include ancient literature in translation (Hesiod, Homer, Sappho, Aischylos,
Sophokles, Euripides and Apollodorus) as well as secondary literature by contemporary authors that provides insights into the religious, social and historical developments that
influenced artists in their choices of subject matter and style.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers, quiz, hour test, final exam. Required fieldtrip to The Metropolitan Museum in New York.

ARTH 214(F) The Landscape of Allusion: Gardens and Landscape Design to c. 1800 (Same as ENVI 216)
This lecture course investigates how humans have shaped and interpreted nature through a study of gardens, architecture, and painting from antiquity to the early nineteenth
century, with a focus on Europe and the early modern period. Starting with the ancient world, it traces the persistence of the classical tradition in European landscape design and
also addresses to a lesser extent Islamic gardens and America. Approaching landscape and the garden as expressive media, we examine the social and intellectual contexts of
their design and themes such as the sacralization of landscape, its use as an instrument of power, and the invention of landscape as an idea. The course will include a field trip to a
local historic garden.
Format: lecture. Requirements: one short paper, one 6–8 page papers, midterm and final exams; field trip to local historic garden.

ARTH 216 Body of Evidence: Greek Sculpture and the Human Figure (Same as CLAS 216) (Not offered 2013-2014)
From the beginnings of Greek sculpture in the eighth century B.C.E. until the end of the Hellenistic period in the first century B.C.E., the human figure remained the most
prominent choice of subject for Greek artists. Introductory classes will cover sculpture in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages but the goal of this course is to study Greek sculpture in
the first millennium B.C.E. with emphasis on ancient Greek attitudes toward the body. We will consider the function, surroundings and reception of male and female figures, both
human and divine, from athletic, religious and funerary contexts, and look at dedications of individual figures as well as the complex mythological narratives found on Greek
temples. Reading material includes ancient literature in translation as well as contemporary critical essays.

ARTH 220 The Mosque (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
A clean place oriented towards Mecca is enough for daily prayer, but the communal practices of Islam entail more than basic rituals and these activities often transpire in formal
architectural settings. These structures range from traditional columned halls of brick and timber to modernist ensembles of reinforced concrete and plate glass; prayer halls may
be open to the elements, flat-roofed or domed; surfaces may be enhanced with carved marble, inlaid wood or glazed tile. Elaborate inscriptions often play an important role in
these buildings. By exploring the commonalities and variations of mosque architecture from Delhi to New York, this course fulfills the terms of the Exploring Diversity Initiative
by offering students an opportunity to see how Islam shapes the built environment in diverse cultural settings and then apply that knowledge with empathy, close to home.
Ultimately, our test case will be the sacred spaces of Williams’ campus, as we seek to understand how architectural form can foster community, manifest belief, activate conviction and sometimes exacerbate religious differences.

ARTH 222(F) Photography in/of the Middle East (Same as ARAB 222) (D)
Since its inception, photography has been globally disseminated but locally inflected, serving disparate documentary needs and expressive purposes in different cultural contexts.
In the Middle East, the powers and pleasures of the medium have been valued by colonial forces, indigenous populations, photojournalists and artists; the resulting images merit
aesthetic appreciation even as they grant visual access to the past and present in complicated places. The course will explore photographic practices in different zones of the
Middle East—e.g., the Holy Land, Egypt or the Persian sphere—by attending to individual photographers and case studies. This tightly focused approach will support, in turn, a
consideration of the burdens and risks of representation in particular circumstances—what work do photographs do? Who resists and who benefits? The general goal will be to
appreciate the diversity of perspectives that underlie renderings of the Middle East.

ARTH 224 Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in Context (Not offered 2013-2014)
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and stained glass produced in France between approximately 1050 and 1400. These
works were not created in isolation from their surroundings; thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylistically, but also in their original functional, social, and sometimes even political settings. The course will emphasize the abbey church and the cathedral, the two major ecclesiastical buildings of this period, as heterogeneous entities that
used architecture, sculpture, stained glass and other media, in conjunction with church ritual, to render their sacred spaces distinct from, and elevated above, the world outside. We
will furthermore try to appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church and the cathedral in high medieval society. Sites for contact with God and for the development of
advanced learning, they could also serve as critical determinants of local economic and political life, and as focuses of pilgrimage, trade, and international cultural exchange.

ARTH 232 The Visual Culture of Renaissance Rome (Not offered 2013-2014)
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the city of Rome saw itself transformed from a shrinking and neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic achievement.
This lecture course focuses on the historical, geographic, and ideological forces behind this period of renovation and restoration forces that reworked the urban fabric of the city
while shaping the character of the visual arts from Filarete and Fra Angelico to Bramante, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We will examine monuments such as Michelangelo’s
Sistine Chapel, then, not only as touchstones for the history of western art, but also as images capable of reflecting, and even constructing, a uniquely Roman sense of power,
time, and historical destiny.

ARTH 238 Greek Art and the Gods (Same as CLAS 248 and REL 216) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In the Iliad, when the god Apollo is visualized, it is as a man, angry in his heart, coming down from the peaks of Olympos, bow and quiver on his shoulders, the arrows clanging
as the god moves, “like the coming of night,” to bring dogs, horses, and men to their deaths. By the end of the Classical period, one statue of the archer god depicted him as a boy
teasing a lizard. In this course, we will examine the development of the images the Greek gods and goddesses, from their superhuman engagement in the heroic world of epic, to
their sometimes sublime artistic presence, complex religious function, and transformation into metaphors in aesthetic and philosophical thought. The course will cover the basic
stylistic, iconographical, narrative, and ritual aspects of the gods and goddesses in ancient Greek culture. The course will address in detail influential artistic monuments, literary
forms, and social phenomena, including the sculptures of Olympia and the Parthenon; divine corporeality in poetry; the theology of mortal-immortal relations; the cultural
functions of visual representations of gods, and the continued interest in the gods long after the end of antiquity. Readings assignments will include selections from Homer,
Hesiod, Sappho, Aischylos, Euripides, Plato, Walter Burkert, Jean-Pierre Vernant, Nikolaus Himmelmann, Erika Simon, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: midterm exam, final exam, final paper.

Rembrandt van Rijn, Frans Hals, Jan Vermeer are only the best-known of the many artists who were active in the northern Netherlands during the seventeenth century. The
variety of their subjects was unprecedented, but the degree of symbolic content in their work is disputed: to what extent was Dutch painting an art of description or of hidden
allegory? We will consider this problem and also give special attention to the ongoing reinterpretations of Rembrandt’s oeuvre and life.

ARTH 264(S) American Art and Architecture, 1600 to Present (Same as AMST 264)
American art is often looked at as a provincial version of the real thing—i.e., European art—and found wanting. This course examines American architecture, painting, and
sculpture on its own terms, in the light of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will be paid to such themes as the Puritan legacy and
attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commercial society; and the tension between the ideal and the real in American works of art.

style and subject matter in the contexts of contemporary cultural phenomena. Through visual analysis students learn the aesthetic, religious, and political ideals and cultural
meanings conveyed in the works of art. Course highlights include the transmission of Buddhism and its art to Japan; Zen Buddhism and its art (dry gardens; temples; and tea
ceremony related art forms) in the context of samurai culture; the sex industry and kabuki theater, their art, and censorship; and the Western influences on Japanese art and culture
and vice versa, (Japanese woodblock prints’ impact on Impressionist and Post–Impressionist paintings, for example).

Beginning in the fourth century, Chinese calligraphy has remained one of the highest art forms in China and in East Asia generally, practiced by the literati, or highly erudite
scholars. This course has two components: art history and studio practice. The first offers students an opportunity to acquire an understanding of theoretical and aesthetic principles of Chinese calligraphy. It also examines the religious, social, and political functions of Chinese calligraphy in ancient and contemporary China. Students will also have an
opportunity to investigate contemporary artists, both Eastern and Western, whose works are either inspired or influenced by Chinese calligraphy, and those whose works are akin
to Chinese calligraphy in their abstraction. Studio practice allows students to apply theories to creating beautiful writing, or calligraphy (from Greek κáλλος kallos “beauty” +
γρα graphê “writing”). This course can be taken as either an Art History or a Studio Art course.
Format: lecture, class discussions and studio practice. Requirements: weekly assignments, a midterm, one short paper, oral presentation, participation in class discussion, a
midterm, a final project (artistic or scholarly), class attendance, film screening
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. This course satisfies the pre-1400, pre-1800 or Art of Middle East, Asia and Africa requirement. This course can count toward the art

ARTH 306T Inventing Christian Art (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Soon after the year 200 CE, the first Christian pictures appeared—in the form of quick, enigmatic sketches—scribbled on the walls of a few underground burial chambers. By
450 CE, dazzlingly large Christian works of art—complex in content, sophisticated in craftsmanship, and made of the most sumptuous materials—had begun to cover the vast
interior surfaces of gigantic churches. By 600 CE, not only had this tradition of monumental public religious art spread around the Mediterranean, but a new tradition of Christian
devotional art had emerged, centered on the sacred portrait, known as the icon, an object often deemed capable of performing miracles. Why did Christians begin to make art?
Why did it take them nearly two centuries to do so? After its initial appearance, why did Christian art evolve in the particular ways that it did, in terms of both its forms and
functions? By addressing such questions, this tutorial aims to investigate not only the origins of Christian art—an issue essential to understanding the entire history of Western
European art—but also the new worlds (religious, political, cultural) that this art helped to invent. At the same time, the course will trace another story of invention: the shifting
interpretations of this art by art historians. What sense have modern scholars made of Early Christian (often also termed “Late Antique”) art? How have the questions asked of
this art by scholars changed over time? What can these changes tell us about the evolution of the discipline of art history itself?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: several papers of 5-7 pages, several written responses to the work of the tutorial partner, and one final paper evaluation will be based on written
work and critical conversation.
Prerequisites: at least one course in Art History preferred. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and then Art majors.

ARTH 315(F) From WCMA to Bilbao and Beyond: The Future of Museums in the Global Cultural Landscape (Same as ARTH 502 and LEAD 302)
Over the past century, Europe and the U.S. have experienced a steady and pervasive growth of public institutions, private collections, and the museum and gallery-going audience. Since the financial meltdown of 2008, however, the “crisis in the arts” has become an ongoing article of faith there among museum professionals and trustees alike,
audience growth seems to have leveled off, and institutional expansion has all but ceased. At the same time, cultural activity in the developing—as reflected in the creation of new
museums, arts institutions, and private collections—is increasing at a remarkable rate. China and the Middle East are prime examples of areas in which governments, corporations, and private individuals are funding the development and construction of new arts institutions at a pace and scale that surpasses anything seen in the West. The central focus
of this course will be (1) to examine the implications of cultural globalization as it impacts museums and the art world; (2) to identity the different and emerging new cultural
paradigms; (3) to analyze the motivations and rationale for large-scale cultural investment world-wide as a political and socio-economic phenomenon; (4) to assess the impact of
the globalization on Western notions of art history and the production and sale of cultural artifacts and objects; and (5) to explore and interrogate the key role of individual
leadership in mobilizing cultural work and institutional change.

ARTH 316T(S) The Italian Villa: Complexity and Contradiction (W)
The villa, or country house, has been interpreted as a paradigmatic cultural institution of the Italian Renaissance. But it has proven difficult for scholars to construct a definition of
the villa that accounts for the geographical diversity and variety of functions and forms that such buildings possessed. This tutorial will examine villas and villa culture in Italy
during the Renaissance and Baroque period, with each meeting organized around a specific case study or theme. Readings from primary and secondary sources will help us to
trace the architectural, cultural, and geographical contours of this slippery concept and to grapple with the various scholarly approaches to it. We will consider such questions as:
How did architects, theorists, and patrons interpret and transform the villas of Roman antiquity? What is the relationship of villa architecture to its painted decoration and surrounding landscape? What can the villa tell us about social relations in this period, or about conceptions of city and country, and work and leisure? What did home mean in the
early modern period?
Format: tutorial. Evaluation based on: quality of and improvement in contributions to discussion, biweekly 5–7–page papers, and alternate–week response papers; final written
exercise addressing major themes of course.

Louis Kahn (1905-74) was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century. For some, his work has reached cult status. We will investigate critical writings about
him, beginning with Vincent Scully’s brief book of 1962 and ending with the most recent, a catalogue of the exhibition in 2012 of his work held at the Vitra Design Museum in
Switzerland. We will study his own writings, some of his buildings (including a field trip to his two museums at Yale), and the film, My Architect, made by his son Nathaniel.

ARTH 330T Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
One might argue that Michelangelo’s enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical canon, is as much a product of his artistic persona as his artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is largely due
to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of any western artist to precede him. And Michelangelo’s mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and study it today. Students of this
tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo through the examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance documents, letters, poetry, and biographies; art historical surveys, monographs, and studies; and documentary and popular film. They will give their critical attention,
however, to the intersection between this artist’s biography and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions arising from this connection. What, for
example, is the nature and reliability of the evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo’s life and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work according to his
philosophical outlook, religious beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Michelangelo responsible for shaping his own persona for posterity? Is the myth of this artist
distinguishable from his “reality?” And to what extent have all these issues shaped our own thinking about artists and the history of art?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on the quality and improvement of written work (5 weekly papers and 5 response papers, and a final written exercise
addressing major themes of the tutorial), and oral dialogue.
Prerequisite: one Art History course of any level. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

ARTH 402 Monuments and The Art of Memorial (Not offered 2013-2014)
The urge to commemorate individuals, heroic acts or historic events whether unspeakable or splendid is both human and timeless. This seminar will document and explore the
concepts behind and the nature of monuments, both commemorative ones, and those that admonish or inform without commemorating a specific event or individual. Students
will study and analyze monuments and memorials from the ancient Mediterranean (Egypt; Mycenae; Greece of the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods; Imperial Rome)
and chart their their influence on monuments in later history, especially those of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The current trend towards countermonuments, or antimonuments, such as Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the Gerzes’ vanishing “Monument Against Fascism, War and Violence and For Peace and Human Rights” in
Hamburg/Harburg will be discussed in light of the monumental tradition of combining word, image, and architecture to create memorials that will endure in both spatial and
temporal terms. Ongoing discussions of Holocaust memorials and the problems inherent in the design of the monument for the WTC will also be addressed. More humble
memorials, such as ephemeral installations, roadside shrines, and photographic assemblages will be included in the discourse concerning the concept of “monument” alongside
topics such as historic buildings and National parks.

ARTH 405 Seminar in Architectural Criticism (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
How does one judge a building? According to its structural efficiency or its aesthetic qualities? Its social responsibility—or just its pizzazz? Depending on the building, and the
critic, any of these questions might be pertinent, or impertinent. This seminar explores architectural criticism, that curious genre between literature and architecture, and looks at
its history, nature and function. We will read and discuss classic reviews by historical and contemporary critics as John Ruskin, Mariana van Rensselaer, Lewis Mumford, Ada
Louise Huxtable and Herbert Muschamp. Insights gained from these discussions will be applied by students to writing their own reviews, which will likewise be discussed in
class. Early assignments will concentrate on mechanics: how to describe a building vividly and accurately, how to balance description and interpretation judiciously, how to
compare. Subsequent ones will be more synthetic, encouraging students to write bold, lively and critical essays. The ultimate goal is to develop a distinctive and effective voice,
and to gain a better understanding of the nature of criticism in general.

ARTH 417 Gender Construction in Chinese Art (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
“One is not born, but rather becomes a woman—Simone de Beauvior”
This course will investigate how gender as a cultural and social construction is visualized in Chinese art. Issues of interest include how gendered space is constructed in Chinese
painting; how landscape paintings can be decoded as masculine or feminine; and ways in which images of women help construct ideas of both femininity and masculinity. This

67

course will also discuss Confucian literati’s [ideals] [of] reclusion and homsociality; didactic art for women; images of concubines, courtesans; and lonely women’s isolation and
abandonment. For example, while nature is often seen as feminine, Chinese landscape painting may be coded as masculine due to its association with the Confucian scholar’s
ideals of eremitism, a means for the cultivation of the mind, and homosociality. On the other hand, the placement of a masculine landscape in feminine space may be seen as
rhetorical strategy, accentuating the lonely woman’s isolation and abandonment, which are important tropes in Chinese erotic poetry as well.
This course fulfills the EDI requirement in that it is designed to enable students to study the logic of gender and sexuality in a context different from their own; to see how both
genders are constructed in relation to each other, and how they interact in the context of class, ideology, politics, and ideals, as well as how we may compare their representation in
China with those of other cultures, notably Japan and the West. Using both visual art and literature, this course also challenges the gender stereotyping that still exists in current
scholarship.
Students will submit five to six 1- to 2-page position papers about readings for the class; one 3- to 4-page midterm paper (draft and revision); two 2- to 3-page respondent’s written
critiques; one 3- to 4-page pre-focus/focus paper (for final research paper proposal), and one 12- to 15-page final research paper (draft and revision).

ARTH 418(F) Myths of Venice: Art and Architecture in a Renaissance City
The Most Serene Republic of Venice perceived itself as unique because of its manmade aqueous environment, stable government and social order, and tradition of mercantile and
cultural ties to the Byzantine Empire and the Levant. The Venetian Renaissance, too, distinguished itself from parallel cultural developments in Central Italian cities like Florence
and Rome such that it complicates the very notion of “rebirth.” This seminar investigates the society and culture of Venice in the sixteenth century through the lens of its art,
architecture, and urbanism. We will examine public, private, urbanistic, and ecclesiastical commissions by Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Sansovino, and Palladio, among others.
In doing so, we consider how these artists and architects together with the Venetian state and individual patrons collectively fashioned an image for and of the city, one that
perpetuated the so–called Myth of Venice. The course assesses the validity of the term Renaissance for Venice and the claim for Venice’s uniqueness, and explores the ways in
which the city itself can be understood as a work of art.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on reading responses, leading class discussion, development of a research project culminating in an oral presentation and 15–20–page paper.

ARTH 422(S) Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the Romanesque Sculpted Portal
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom. According to a contemporary chronicler, “it was as if the whole earth,
having cast off the old by shaking itself, were clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church.” During the course of the eleventh century, the designers of these
structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label “Romanesque.” One of the most innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of
monumental sculpture, absent in Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was the portal, which marked the threshold between the profane realm of the
outside world and the sacred space of the church. This seminar will investigate the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted portal and examine in detail its greatest
manifestations. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these often complex sculptural schemes within their original functional and physical contexts. What role did this
imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor’s overall experience of the church? And what did it mean to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of “God’s temple”?

ARTH 426(F) Pictures That Rocked the Nation: Courbet and Manet in Second Empire France (Same as WGSS 426) (D)
How do we recognize or see diversity in the works of canonical artists? If modernist painting has often been understood to put pressure on existing power relations, the stylistic
innovation that defines it has just as often been used to veil its controversial subject matter. The aim of this course is two-fold: 1) to call attention to difference through comparative analysis and to consider how and why identifying it is meaningful; 2) to detail the changes in historiography since the 1970s that have enabled discussions of difference (sex,
class, race, ethnicity, sexuality) and the challenges they present. The course demonstrates that the Second Empire (1851-1870) in France was an especially fertile period for
innovations in style and subject matter that generated both outrage and incomprehension. In the wake of the revolution of 1848, realism and its rallying cry (“il faut être de son
temps”) brought home subjects that heretofore had been safely displaced to the classical or exotic worlds as they were imagined by the West. The Second Empire coincided with
the birth of mass culture so that artists had access to new types of imagery and increasing contact with racy and controversial subjects.
This course will investigate polemical works by Gustave Courbet (i.e. Burial at Ornans, Origin of the World) and Edouard Manet (i.e. Olympia, The Execution of Emperor
Maximilian) through the lens of critical writings of the 1850s and 1860s (i.e. Baudelaire, Proudhon, Zola) as well as revisionist writings from the 1970s to the present ( Homi
Bhahba, T.J. Clark, Richard Dyer, Michael Fried, Tamar Garb, Sander Gilman, Zine Magubane, Linda Nochlin, and Gayatri Spivak). We will consider the relationship of Manet’s and Courbet’s works to academic ones, including orientalist paintings by Ingres and Gérôme, and to vanguard pictures of the next generation (i.e. the homoerotic work of
Caillebotte and Bazille, the “sex workers” of Degas’s toilette scenes). Finally, we will examine the legacy of Courbet and Manet during the period when difference began to be
represented in the work of artists such as Judy Chicago, Yasumasa Morimura, Cindy Sherman, Samuel Fosso, and Carrie Mae Weems.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly 1- to 2-page position papers; oral presentation and final research paper, 10-15 pages.

Art of the 1600s represents a highpoint in artists’ ability and interest in conveying “the passions of the soul” through the actions of the body. The range of feelings represented had
never been broader than at this time. In the seminar we will distinguish unusual from conventional poses (e.g., melancholy, wonder, musing),track how long the conventional
poses had been in use, and differentiate poses and gestures that had unisex use from those that remained gender-specific or preferred. We will also examine which poses, if any,
individual artists (e.g., Caravaggio, Artimesia Gentileschi, Rubens, Rembrandt, Leyster, Bernini, and Poussin) favored.

ARTH 451(S) Ideal Bodies: The Modern Nude and Its Dilemmas (Same as WGSS 451)
The nineteenth century is so dominated by the female nude that the very term “nude” has come to stand for the female body. And yet, the history of the nude during this period is
not devoid of male bodies. This course looks at both male and female nudes in order to understand how the nude became gendered female. Required readings include Kenneth
Clark’s classic study The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (1956) and Lynda Nead’s The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality (1992), with special attention to texts which
show how the nude and the discourse of the ideal function to obscure social issues. We will explore the ways in which certain types of bodies have been defined in opposition to
the white western ideal, and thereby exoticized or marginalized. Our prime focus is the work of David, Ingres, Géricault, Courbet, Manet, Morisot and Renoir but more popular
nineteenth-century images as well as selected works by artists working today will be discussed.

The goal is to think about describing bodies from a variety of disciplinary approaches and genres of writing. Its focus is on living bodies, or bodies that were once alive, with an
emphasis on bodies that move i.e., performing bodies—actors, dancers, singers—and what makes them unique. We will also consider objects associated with bodies, and the
ways they are animated, including how they are animated when the person who had them dies. The course is meant for juniors, seniors, and graduate students who wish to
analyze bodies from different disciplinary formations-art, theatre, literature, anthropology, philosophy—and who have a particular interest in writing. We will read scholarly
writing, fiction, New Yorker profiles, as well as memoir/autobiography, and take each as a model through which to write about a person or an object redolent of a person.
Possible readings: Roland Barthes on cultural theory and representation; Zine Magubane and Zadie Smith on othered bodies; Tamar Garb on portraiture; Elaine Scary on the
body in pain; Joan Acocella, Hilton Als, Judith Thurman and other writers on the arts; Judith Butler and Peggy Phelan on the performative body; Joseph Roach, Diana Taylor,
and Michael Taussig on the body, memory, and ritual; Marvin Carlson and Terry Castle on haunting; and Bill Brown on things. These will be supplemented by selected tapes of
live performances as well as films.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: alternating weekly essays (4-5 pages) and responses (2-4 pages) as well as discussion; a final paper that distills the writer’s own project from

68

these cumulative exercises.
Prerequisites: ARTH 101-102, or permission of the instructor; a writing sample that conveys the kind of subject you might be interested in pursuing. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

ARTH 462(F) Art of California: Pacific Standard Time (Same as AMST 462 and LATS 462) (D) (W)
In this course, we will study the visual arts and culture of California after 1960 and consider the region’s place in modern art history. We will focus on a series of recent exhibitions
organized as part of a Getty initiative entitled Pacific Standard Time. Diverse in scope, these shows explored important developments in postwar art in California, including,
feminist art, African American assemblage, Chicano collectives, Modernist architecture, craft, and queer activism. In this seminar, we will pursue research projects directly
related to the art exhibitions we study, and examine southern California conceptualism, photography, performance, painting, sculpture (including, assemblage and installation),
and video by artists both canonical and lesser known. Student projects will analyze the critical responses to the exhibitions, while also exploring the roles of archives, art criticism,
and curatorial practice in contemporary art history. Class meetings and projects at the Williams College Museum of Art will provide the opportunity to see and study artworks
first hand, especially with the exhibition Now Dig This!: Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960-1980, which will be on display at WCMA during the fall semester. This course fulfills
the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement as it offers students a comparative study of cultures and societies and provides various interdisciplinary perspectives on the art and
visual culture of a specific region.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short writing and research assignments, oral presentations, class participation, and a final research paper of 16-20 pages
written in stages over the course of the semester
Prerequisites: ARTH 102. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference: senior Art major and senior Latina/o Studies concentrators

ARTH 463 The Holocaust Visualized (Same as JWST 463) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This seminar will examine how memories of the Holocaust have been conveyed through visual means and consider what historical, cultural and political circumstances have
caused various nations to remember the Holocaust differently. We will discuss the issues prompted by public memorials, exhibitions and, as one writer puts it, the “museumification” of concentration camps. How should we define the Holocaust? Whose memory should take precedence? Should we allow collapsing sites of memory to collapse. What is
lost or gained by the inclusion of texts with images? How might memory be misrepresented by the exhibition of visual materials such as video testimony, photographs and
artifacts? In addition, we will study art about the Holocaust, including Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel, Maus, and films, such as Night and Fog, Shoah and Schindler’s List, to ask
whether constructed or simulated images can convey the experience of the Holocaust as well as documentary ones. Additionally, we need to consider ways in which the images
of the Holocaust, by now too well-known, have been instrumentalized by groups wishing to minimize the Shoah (e.g., the recent Holocaust cartoon competition in Tehran, 2006.)
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussion and regular participation in a class list server discussion group, one oral presentation, and one
research paper; no exams.; fieldtrip to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. (estimated cost: $260).

ARTH 464 Latina/o Visual Culture: Histories, Identities, and Representation (Same as LATS 464) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
This course examines the contemporary history of Latina/o visual culture and explores the various relations between cultural expression, identity formation, and public representation. We will begin by considering the critical and aesthetic practices that emerged in the context of civil rights actions and nationalist movements, which often focused on
issues of visibility, self-representation, and autonomy. The topics of immigration, transnationalism, and the “Latinization” of the United States will then be analyzed in depth as
we examine representations of and representations by Latina/os in film and television, the visual arts, advertising, and other forms of popular media. Throughout the course, we
will investigate the role of visual culture in determining taste and trends as well as shaping notions of belonging and cultural citizenship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a research presentation, several short writing assignments (1-2 pages), and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: LATS 105 or ARTH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies and Art History seniors and

ARTH 466 Hellenistic Sculpture and the Beginning of Art History (Same as CLAS 466) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The Hellenistic period begins with Alexander the Great’s extension of the borders of the Greek world from the central Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus River. Kingdoms
replaced city-states as important centers of power. Increased trade and movement of individuals between Greece, Egypt and the Near and Middle East, encouraged a cross-cultural examination of religion, philosophy, literature and art. The new cosmopolitan attitude brought about not only a revolution in sculptural ideals and forms but in the approach
towards art in general. Museums and libraries are established for the first time, and the concept of collecting art takes hold. We see a historical self-consciousness, and self-referential quality in sculpture as well as a new interest in theatricality and the diversity of human nature and experience. This course will explore Hellenistic sculpture through the
close study of individual works of art of the fourth through first centuries B.C.E., as well as the broader philosophical, religious, literary and political forces that encouraged its
innovations. Reading material includes ancient literature in translation, recent surveys of Hellenistic sculpture and recent critical essays. Interested upper level students of any
major are welcome. We will begin the term with a brief history of Greek sculpture for those who haven’t taken a course in ancient art.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation in class discussion; two short reports which form the basis for a term paper, 20 pages in length, due at the end of the semester.
Prerequisites: ARTH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12). Preference given to Art majors, graduate students, and students of any major interested in art and thought in

across political, religious and cultural boundaries. This course is about three regions—United States, France and the Persian sphere—and the images that mediate and document
their interactions. Along the way, we will address important issues like iconoclasm and aniconism, common types like veiled women and pious men, and asymmetrical relationships like Orientalism. The peculiar nature of portraiture will be a prominent theme. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative in its emphasis on comparative cultures
and its effort to promote understanding of contextualized meanings in diverse settings.

ART STUDIO COURSES
ARTS 100(F) Drawing I*
Drawing extends your observational skills and, when combined with your intuitive and intellectual qualities, offers you an excellent means of communicating how, what, when
and where you engage your experiences. As in any language, the descriptions of those observations begin with basic details and, with extensive practice, become more articulate.
This requires of you the ability to focus, to frequently repeat the mundane in order to achieve the eloquent and to put aside judgment in favor of developing a self-critical

69

awareness. The course features basic skill sets that rely on close scrutiny of our primary subjects: still life and landscape. The materials used will permit you to better understand
their manipulation in describing form, shape, light and texture composed in illusionistic and abstract space. As your work matures during the term, we will begin a more careful
examination of the rich, complex and challenging relationships between form and content.
Format: studio. Requirements: evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced, successful completion of all assignments, and attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference given to Art Majors (declared); students who have previously enrolled but have been dropped from the course,
first–year and sophomore students.

ARTS 101 Artists Respond to Dangerous Times (Same as AMST 101) (D) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This introductory studio art course focuses on how contemporary time-based artists engage their historical moment. We will look ways in which language, performance,
and the moving image can be used to reckon with the forces that historical events and conditions press upon us as citizens, art makers, and living beings, and think about
art-making as a dialogical social force that has the potential to press back. Students will develop their own video, performance, or written work in this vein. The course will
give special consideration to particular forms of artist-made film and video: the essay film, activist/grassroots/social media, and performance-based and narrative media that
reflect on historical events and the ongoing present. We will look at a variety of work, including: Fiona Banner, Catherine Bigelow, Wafaa Bilal, Nao Bustamante, Paul
Chan, Adam Curtis, Jean-Luc Godard, Danny Glover, Dara Greenwald, Sharon Hayes, Spike Lee, Zoe Leonard, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Anna Deveare Smith, Lisa
Steele, Agnes Varda, The Yes Men, Haskell Wexler, and collectives including ACT UP, Pink Bloque, TVTV, and Occupy Wall Street. Readings will include work by
Margaret Atwood, Jerome Bruner, Judith Butler, Gregg Bordowitz, Joan Didion, George Lipsitz, Chantal Mouffe, Paul Virilio, David Foster Wallace, among others.
Format: studio. Students will produce three short videos, essayistic or fictional non-academic written works, or action/performance works; evaluation will be based primarily on these works and class participation.

ARTS 324(F) The Documentary Photography Project (Same as INTR 324)
While every image documents something, the field of documentary photography traditionally uses still images to relate a story about the events and people that shape our world.
Students will learn skills required to produce an effective visual narrative. Technical aspects of image acquisition that are particularly useful in conveying information will be
reviewed, including manipulation of exposure controls, wide angle composition, and location lighting. Conceptual topics will include myths about “truth” and “objectivity” in
photography, and the responsibilities of the documentarian to his/her subjects. Students will practice different types of documentation, and consider techniques for approaching,
photographing and interviewing subjects. The practical aspects of developing a story, gaining access, working in unfamiliar environments and editing both individual images and
series will be examined. Students will work throughout the semester on planning and executing a documentary project, culminating in an exhibition of their work, and a production of a print–on–demand book. Acceptance into the class requires strong technical competence, and a demonstrated ability to work independently and to commit to a long–term
project. Participants should expect to spend significant time working off campus.
Format: studio. Requirements: class attendance is mandatory; participation in class discussion and critiques 20 %; aesthetic and technical strengths of shooting exercises 20 %;
aesthetic and technical strength of final project 60 %.
Prerequisites: ARTS/INTR 252 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 8 (expected: 8). Preference based on portfolio review.
Lab fee: $200.
Hour: 7:00-9:40 p.m. M

ARTS 329(F) Architectural Design II
A continuation and expansion of ideas and skills learned in Architectural Design I. There will be four to six design projects requiring drawings and models, each of which will
emphasize particular aspects of architectural theory and design, including sustainability and material properties. Visiting critics will discuss student work. The course is useful for
students thinking of applying to graduate school in architecture.
Evaluation will be based on quality of designs during the term. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: ARTS 220 is highly recommended. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R

ARTS 333T Narrative Strategies (Same as COMP 333T) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In this tutorial, we will examine the use of narrative in a range of fine art practices, which could include painting, drawing, video, sculpture, installation, public art, and sound art.
Students who are interested in telling or referencing stories in their work in some way will be given the opportunity to develop their ideas and skills in a challenging studio class.
In addition to intensive projects, we will look at and discuss the work of artists such as Huma Bhabha, Kara Walker, Joe Sacco, Lydia Davis, Matthew Barney, Raymond
Pettibon, Todd Solondz, Sophie Calle, Jenny Holzer, and Jessica Stockholder among others. One of the aims of this course is to challenge traditional notions and expectations of
narrative. For instance, what could minimally constitute a narrative piece? How do different mediums allow for time to unfold in unexpected ways? How does omission play a
powerful role in a narrative? How might the role of the narrator (often so powerful and present in novels and short stories) change in a visual arts context?
This is a studio tutorial with an emphasis on demanding, weekly projects. Students will work both in mediums of their choice and be asked to experiment with new, unfamiliar
formats. Readings and screenings will be required in addition to tutorial hours. Students are required to have taken two 200 level classes in any medium (or by permission of the
instructor).
Format: tutorial. Evaluation based on assignments, studio performance, class participation, and attendance.
Prerequisites: students are required to have taken at least two ARTS 200 level classes in any medium (or by permission of the instructor). Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).
Preference given to studio majors.
Not available for the Gaudino or pass/fail options.

ARTS 340T Erasure (Not offered 2013-2014)
[Rubbed out, scraped away, excised, effaced, or deleted] The means by which we commonly make a modification in a text, image or calculation is to remove and replace the
edited particular with its substitute. In this editing-through addition, subtraction or both-we engage a renovation that involves a host of intellectual and experiential strategies.
These [erasures] create [spaces]. Left blank, the erased article suggests there is no known replacement. If the article is not totally scraped away, the visible remaining under-layer
serves as memento of the preceding action (palimpsest). Layers accreted upon one another may bury selected particulars in an archeologic strata. If vigorously removed, the
heightened evidence of the erasing action becomes a testament to the significance of the desire to make the subject disappear. Hence, when we examine the emotive range of
erasure, we witness the fuller psychological and intellectual dimensional potential of the edit. The scale of erasure stretches this dimension further. A simple edit may reveal a
better choice and change the criticality of the outcome minutely or dramatically. Genocide as erasure, however, moves us to quite another plane. History and our interpretation of
those events are variously defined by what has been inscribed and what has been de-scribed (Derrida).
This tutorial-through studio practice, reading/viewing and critical analysis-will wander through a variety of conditions of erasure and how each might inform individual and
collective projects. Weekly responses to a series of seven studio prompts will be wrought in either two-dimensional (digital photography, drawing, collage, painting) or three-dimensional media (sculpture, installation, performance).To assist in stretching the directions of each prompt, students will study: Visual work of, (including but not limited to):
Marcel Duchamp, Arakawa and Madeline Gins, Julie Mehrutu, Ghada Amer, Joseph Kosuth, Cy Twombly, Gabriel de la Mora, Cindy Sherman, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper
Johns. Texts by, (including but not limited to): Franz Kafka, Ralph Ellison, Susan Stewart, Percival Everett, Akira Mizuta Lippit, de Sade. Films by, (including but not limited to):

Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure), Hiroshi Teshigahara (Woman in the Dunes), Shohei Imamura, (Black Rain)
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced, successful completion of all assignments, and attendance.
Prerequisites: students are required to have taken at least two ARTS 200-level studio classes in any medium, one of which should be the medium chosen for this tutorial; two-dimensional (digital photography, drawing, collage, painting) or three-dimensional media (sculpture, installation, performance). Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.
EPPING
ARTS 344(F) Abstraction
Abstraction has been a persistent and defining visual idea of the twentieth and twenty-first century. This workshop for intermediate and advanced drawing, painting and sculpture
students will investigate the principles of abstract design as well as some of the artists that helped to develop the genre. Among the concepts to be explored are cubism, field
composition, and gestural painting. Students will work from a variety of sources, including the human body, still life, and found photography. Although the majority of assignments are in drawing and painting, the final multi-week independent project may be realized in multi-media.
Format: studio; the final four weeks will be dedicated to independent projects. Requirements: weekly studio assignments. Evaluation will be based on the quality of visual
projects, and class participation.
Prerequisites: ARTS 230 or a 200-level painting course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference: Studio Art majors, seniors, juniors, sophomores.
Lab fee: of approximately $275 to be added to the student’s term bill.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 T and 1:10-3:50 T
GLIER
ARTS 364T(F) Artists’ Books
This course will investigate the processes and ideas associated with the making of artists’ books, works that are fine art objects that generally use visual images and/or text. For
example, individual projects could include visual diaries, three-dimensional pop-up books, solely visual narratives, autobiography, literary text/image collaborations, animated
“”flip” books, or sculptural books. Limited-editions as well as one-of-a-kind work will be encouraged. Media options include painting, drawing, etching, lithography, relief
printing, photography and bookbinding techniques (from sewn bindings to boxes). As a tutorial, this course is designed to support individual directions, to stress student participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine different points of view. Students will meet in groups of two for critique of individual projects in the tutorial format each
week—students are expected to give 20- to 30-minute presentations about their work and to respond to questions and criticism. Students will also meet once a week as a group for
demonstrations, lectures, and discussion of readings.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on student participation and the conceptual and technical quality of the work. There will be required field trips during the semester to the
Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and WCMA. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: any ONE of the following: ARTS 230, 241, 257, 263, 264, or 266. Enrollment limit: 9.
Hour: 1:10–3:50 M
TAKENAGA
ARTS 365T Multiples and Painting (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will investigate the processes and ideas used in combining reproduced images with acrylic painting in a synthesis of the multiple and the one of a kind, the mechanized image and the more direct application of paint. The multiple is often viewed as more “mediated” than an original, unique object—while painting is often romanticized as a
more intuitive eye to hand process. Students will explore how one can reconcile these two approaches as contemporary artists in a time when the mass-produced multiple is so
present in our visual culture. Reproduced images may include prints (etchings, lithographs, relief prints, etc), photographs, or copies that will be collaged, assembled and redefined through the addition of painting. While the subject matter will be open, there will be general thematic assignments during the first half of the semester. As a tutorial, this
course is designed to meet individual needs, stress student participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine differing points of view. Students will meet in groups of
two or three for critiques of individual projects in the tutorial format: i.e., students are expected to give a half hour presentation weekly regarding their projects and selected
readings, and to respond to criticism and questions by the peer student and the instructor. Students will also meet once a week as a group for demonstrations, slide presentations,
and on-campus field trips.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on student participation as well as the conceptual and technical quality of the work. Lab fee.
Prerequisite: ARTS 100 plus any one of the following: ArtS 241, 243, 254, 257, 263, 264, or 266. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference is given to Studio Art majors.
TAKENAGA
ARTS 376(S) Sculpture Expanded
This course is designed to expand the definitions of sculpture by adding interdisciplinary solutions to the artistic ideas at hand. The class will be using a wide array of artistic
practices towards developing three–dimensional spaces and emphasizing environmental or performative outcomes. Media such as video, drawing, painting, photography, architecture, as well as other artistic practices may be incorporated to create visual solutions to the projects. This is an upper level course focusing on developing one’s artistic voice
while simultaneously strengthening technical and analytical skills. A substantial amount of time outside of class is expected to complete these projects.
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced, the depth and quality of the investigative process, participation in critiques, and attendance. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: ARTS 275 or any 200 level course in the media that will be incorporated or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T
PODMORE
ARTS 418(S) Senior Seminar
The purpose of the Senior Seminar is to strengthen ideas, develop formal skills and practice critical analysis while creating original art. Students may work in any medium in
which they have prior experience. At the beginning of the class, each student defines his/her project and completes the necessary research. The following weeks are spent
producing new work in preparation for an exhibition at the Williams College Museum of Art. The class will meet in large and small groups throughout the semester for critique
and discussion. This course is for students who have the ideas and discipline to work independently; participants are expected to be highly motivated and to be exceptionally
engaged in the class discourse. Students are responsible for buying their own materials. Evaluation is based on the following: consistency of effort, the quality of analysis in
critique, the quality of the portfolio at midterm and the quality of the final portfolio.
Format: one full class meeting a week on Wednesday for discussion and workshop and one small group meeting a week for critique to be scheduled once class begins.
Prerequisite: Studio Art major. Permission of the instructor is required for History and Practice majors. Enrollment limit: none.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W

ARTS 497(F), 498(S) Independent Study
With current staffing limitations, it is difficult for studio faculty to supervise more than a very few independent studies projects. We feel our curriculum includes rich and varied
offerings and believe that the need for most independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has completed two 200-level ARTS courses and one 300-level ARTS tutorial.
Permission of instructor is required.

GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
To qualify for the Master of Arts degree in art history, candidates complete a minimum of twelve courses for graduate credit plus two winter study periods, the latter comprising a Study Trip in the first year (ARTH 51) and preparation of a Draft Qualifying Paper in the second (ARTH 52). Students must also demonstrate reading proficiency in two
foreign languages, one of them German (for more specific information on the language requirements, see below, after the listing for ARTH 597/598). At the end of the second
year, all students present a shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in the annual Graduate Symposium.
At least eight of the twelve courses must be graduate seminars. Included among them are four required of all students: ARTH 504,“Methods of Art History,” to be taken during
the first semester; ARTH 506, “Graduate Art History Writing Workshop” and ARTH 507, “Object Workshop,” to be taken in the second; and ARTH 509, “Graduate Student
Symposium,” to be taken in the fourth.
Students must also fulfill a distribution requirement by undertaking coursework in three of six areas:
(1) East Asian, Indian, Islamic art
(2) Ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art
(3) Early Christian, Byzantine, and Western Medieval art to 1400
(4) Western art, 1400 to 1780
(5) Western art, 1780 to present
(6) Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas (Pre-Hispanic or Native American cultures)
Students may petition the Director to apply a thematic or non-period specific course toward the distribution requirement by demonstrating substantial work in an appropriate area.

Undergraduate Courses and Private Tutorials
With permission from the Director and the individual instructors, students may take up to four undergraduate courses for graduate credit, with the understanding that research
papers submitted in such courses meet a standard commensurate with those prepared for graduate seminars.

73

In addition to regularly offered seminars and classes, students may arrange up to two private tutorials (ARTH 595/596) by submitting petitions to the Director describing the
substance of their projects, including bibliography, and the nature of the work they will submit for evaluation. The petitions must be co-signed in advance by both the students and
their faculty supervisors.
Of the minimum requirement of twelve courses, the combined number of private tutorials and undergraduate courses applied to the degree may not exceed four.

The Qualifying Paper
The Qualifying Paper is normally a revision of a seminar or private tutorial paper produced in one of the previous three semesters, expanded and refined over the second
Winter Study term and a portion of the fourth semester. Students submit the topic of the Qualifying Paper in writing to the Director by the final day of exams of their third
semester. Before this, students must obtain their original faculty supervisor’s agreement to be engaged in the Qualifying Paper process.
On the first Friday of their fourth semester, students submit drafts of their Qualifying Paper, including illustrations, to three faculty readers (generally the original faculty
supervisor, the Director, and the Post-Doctoral Teaching Fellow). Although a draft, this version of the paper should be brought to a high level of completion.
Early in the fourth semester, students and their readers meet together to discuss the drafts. Within six weeks of these discussions (at a date determined by the Director), students
submit their Qualifying Papers. Qualifying Papers should not exceed 8,000 words, including footnotes and bibliography.

The Graduate Symposium
All second-year students speak in the Symposium, presenting 20-minute talks developed from their Qualifying Papers. Each student has an ad hoc committee to give advice in
preparing these presentations (ad hoc committees comprise, but are not limited to, the Director, one additional faculty mentor, one first-year graduate student, and one secondyear graduate student). Preparations include at least three practice runs for each student. Speakers present the first and third of these run-throughs to the ad hoc committee, the
second to the other second-year students in a workshop scheduled by the Director.

Grades and Academic Standing
The Program uses the following grading system:
A+
A
AB+

= truly exceptional (4.33)
= outstanding (4.00)
= excellent (3.67)
= good (3.33)

B
BC
E

=
=
=
=

satisfactory (3.00)
barely adequate (2.67)
inadequate (0)
failing (0)

Courses in which students receive a grade below B- do not receive graduate credit.
Letter grades are used in all seminars except ARTH 507 and 509. These and the Winter Study courses (ARTH 51 and 52) are Pass/Fail. Grades in language courses are
converted to Pass/Fail on the Williams transcript and are not calculated in the GPA. The Director reviews students’ records at the end of the first year; those with GPAs of 3.00 or
lower may be asked to resign from the Program.
Course instructors set the deadlines for coursework. If students seek and receive extensions that result in semester grades of Incomplete, they must hand in their work by the
instructor’s revised deadline, which will be no later than the second Monday of the next semester’s classes. Extensions beyond this date will be solely at the discretion of the
Director (in consultation with the instructor).
Students who resign from the Program may, after a period of at least one year, petition to the Director for re-admission. Such a petition must include evidence that deficiencies
have been remedied and that the student is capable of completing the course of study without further interruption.
The M.A. requirements are designed for completion in two consecutive academic years in residence. There is no credit for coursework done prior to matriculation in the
Program. The Program is full-time, requires students to live in Williamstown or its vicinity, and does not normally admit students on a part-time basis.

ARTH 500(F) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: The Intentional and the Unintentional (Same as ARTH 400)
This seminar looks at the place of intention-or the absence thereof-in the making and reception of art through both a selection of critical and theoretical texts that grapple with this
question and a series of case studies of objects and images. In the first instance the seminar is historiographic, addressing a body of 20th-century writings, from the New Critics to
the poststructuralist Death of the Author, that question the place of authorial intent in the evaluation or interpretation of a work, as well as the targets of these critiques and more
recent responses to them (in wresting authority away from the producer, have we given over too much to the consumer?). Keeping in mind these theoretical points of reference,
the seminar will move to a range of historical case studies in (mainly) Western art, from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, evaluating both human intention (artists, patrons,
even viewers) and the various forms of its absence. We will consider miraculous (“acheiropoietic”) objects, images “made by nature” and other nonhuman actors (why do cats
paint?), the place of the unconscious, artwork made using the operations of chance, collaborations in which any singular intention is difficult to establish, examples in which
intention is simply inaccessible to the interpreter, and examples in which it is, or seems, all too apparent. Students may present and write on examples from their particular fields
of specialization.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, brief presentations of readings, a final presentation and a research paper of 15-20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Places for 8 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 8 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured. Preference given to senior Art
History majors and Graduate Program students.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R

ARTH 500(S) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: Art and Nature in Early Modern Italy (Same as ARTH 400)
This seminar examines the myriad relationships of art and nature in Italy from ca. 1450 to ca. 1650. Using contemporary texts and visual examples, we will address a series of
connections and tensions: the relationship of art and science (what does the scientific knowledge of nature have to do with the techne of visual art?); nature as an artist and its
paragone (comparison and competition) with human artifice; arts that use nature as their medium (alchemy, medicine, engineering, and the visual arts-including, most prominently, now-marginalized arts such as ceramics and horticulture); nature as an object of visual representation (meaning the depiction of the nature of things primarily, and only
secondarily referring to landscape); and nature as a unique set of qualities inherent in the artist and driving art production (a constant point of reference, for example, in Vasari’s
Lives of the Artists).
Reading knowledge of Latin or Italian strongly suggested but not required; most readings will be done in English and alternatives will be offered where no English translation
exists. Before the first meeting, students should have read Aristotle’s Physics in any modern edition.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, brief presentations of readings, a final presentation and a research paper of 15-20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Places for 8 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 8 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured. Preference given to senior Art
History majors and Graduate Program students.

ARTH 502(F) From WCMA to Bilbao and Beyond: The Future of Museums in the Global Cultural Landscape (Same as ARTH 315 and LEAD 302)
Over the past century, Europe and the U.S. have experienced a steady and pervasive growth of public institutions, private collections, and the museum-and gallery-going audience. Since the financial meltdown of 2008, however, the “crisis in the arts” has become an ongoing article of faith there among museum professionals and trustees alike,
audience growth seems to have leveled off, and institutional expansion has all but ceased. At the same time, cultural activity in the developing world—as reflected in the creation
of new museums, arts institutions, and private collections—seems to be increasing at a remarkable rate. China and the Middle East are prime examples of where governments,
corporations, and private individuals are funding the development and construction of new arts institutions at a pace and scale that surpass anything seen in the West. The central
focus of this course will be (1) to examine the implications of cultural globalization as it impacts museums and the art world; (2) to identify the different and emerging new
cultural paradigms; (3) to analyze the motivations and rationale for large-scale cultural investment world-wide as a political and socio-economic phenomenon; (4) to assess the
impact of the globalization on Western notions of art history and the production and sale of cultural artifacts and objects; and (5) to explore and interrogate the key role of
individual leadership in mobilizing cultural work and institutional change.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, brief presentations of readings, a final presentation and a research paper of 15-20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 14 (9 undergrads [ARTH 315] and 5 graduate [ARTH 502] students) (expected: 10). Preference given to senior Art History majors, majors in
Leadership Studies, seniors across disciplines, and Graduate Program students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R

KRENS

ARTH 503(S) Studies in Decorative Arts, Material Culture, Design History, 1700–2000
The course will explore the methods, goals, and theoretical framework in which three–dimensional, functional objects have been and are interpreted. Class discussion will
include distinction between “fine arts,” “decorative arts,” and “design”; role and limitation of connoisseurship; the current relationship of object study to aesthetics, social history,
history of technology, anthropology, sociology, gender and ethnic studies; the effect of the market on history and scholarship; and current theories on the role of objects in human
life.

CONFORTI
ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History
This course on art-historical method is designed to offer students a historiographic overview of the discipline of art history, with emphasis on developments over the past halfcentury. We will survey the most influential concepts of the discipline, the evolving tasks it has set itself, and the methods it has adopted for executing them. Works of art and other
types of images will inevitably enter into our discussions, but the main objects of study will be texts about art, particularly texts explicitly addressing or exemplifying various
methods for a historical study of art. Topics include: art history and its objects; looking and describing; “forms in the realm of time”; sign, meaning, affect, interpretation; art
history and difference; image and function; art history as representation.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several oral presentations on specific texts, a mid-term paper, and a longer final paper.
Limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.

ARTH 506(S) Graduate Art History Writing Workshop
A common and depressing consequence of too much education is how our writing tends to devolve, as the task of saying what we mean is complicated by new anxieties: trying to
impress our potential employers, intimidate our competition, and claim our place in an intellectual community. In many professions, bad prose tends to proliferate as scholars,
trying above all to avoid mistakes, become tentative, obscurantist, and addicted to jargon. In this course we will try to relearn the basic skills of effective communication and adapt
them to new and complicated purposes. In class we will go over weekly or bi-weekly writing assignments, but we will also look at the essays you are writing for your other
courses, to give them an outward form that will best display their inner braininess. Among other things, I am a fiction writer, and part of my intention is to borrow the techniques
of storytelling to dramatize your ideas successfully.
Limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of art, artifacts, and decorative arts objects; give them an understanding of the
history of artist materials and methods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation-training course but is structured to provide
a broader awareness for those who are planning careers involving work with cultural objects.
Classes are held at the Williamstown Art Cconservation Center in the Stone Hill Center on the Clark campus. Field trips this semester will include the Governor A. Nelson
Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York, and two others to be announced. Students receive a syllabus with session outlines and required reading lists.
Required reading is mainly from books on reserve at the Clark Library. No book purchases are required.
Format: slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical examinations, and group discussions.
Attendance is required at all sessions. The course grade is based on exams given throughout the semester; there is no final exam.
Enrollment limit: 14. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.

ARTH 551(F) Orientalism
This course explores the rise of the painter/traveler in Europe in the 19th century, and in particular those artists who journeyed to North Africa and the Middle East. In the first
weeks of the course we will explore influential critiques of Orientalist representation (Said, Nochlin, Grosrichard); the intersection of Orientalism and post-colonial studies;
theories of ideology, travel, and tourist-studies; and related intellectual frameworks that have been brought to bear on the subject in recent decades. But the course will also
explore approaches to Orientalist depictions that propose to break from “critique” across a range of methodological perspectives. Artists include Delacroix, Gérôme, Roberts,
Regnault, Fromentin, and Sargent—in short, the vast inventory of figures who traveled to North Africa and the Middle East, following on the heels of colonial expansion, in an
effort to renew their vocations.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper of 20-25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.

ARTH 556(S) From Furness to Wright: the Roots of Architectural Modernism, 1865-1914 (Same as ARTH 456)
A building should express the facts of its program and materials—directly and without sentimentality. A building should be a physical manifestation of the personality and ego of
its creator. These demands are mutually exclusive—on the one hand, radical objectivity, on the other, radical subjectivity—yet together they form the basis for modern architecture at the turn of the 20th century. The architectural lineage of Frank Furness, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright is marked especially by the high degree of tension between
the competing demands of objectivity and personal expression. This seminar will explore the theoretical roots of their architecture, its philosophical sources in transcendentalism,
Unitarianism, German romanticism; and treating such aspects as decorative arts, architectural education and theory, and architectural autobiography.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 25-page research paper and seminar presentation; regular participation in seminar discussions.
Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). places for 7 undergraduate [ARTH 456] and 7 graduate students [ARTH 556] assured. Preference given to senior Art History majors and
Graduate Program students.

This course will focus on the first hundred years of photography, from the 1830s to the 1930s, considering the medium as a creative vehicle and theoretical construct. Early
photography in Europe and America witnessed a vast array of technologies, functions, and aesthetic motivations. Exploring both primary documents (treatises, artist statements)
and the critical, secondary literature, the seminar will investigate the full spectrum of photography from “fine art” to book illustration. A main focus of our reading will be
historical texts that question the shifting status of photography. Using the Clark’s photography holdings as our base of inquiry, students will also view Photobooks in the Clark
library and visit the Williams College Museum of Art.
Format: seminar. Requirements: involved class participation, several short presentations, and a term paper of 20 pages.
Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour: 10:00 a.m.-12:40 p.m. W

ARTH 561T(F) Writing About Bodies
The goal of this course is to think about describing bodies from a variety of disciplinary approaches and genres of writing. It expands the art historical focus on represented bodies
to include the experience of real bodies in time and space, including performing bodies, such as actors, dancers, and singers, and what makes them unique. It also considers
objects associated with bodies, and the ways they are animated, including how they are animated when the person who had them dies. The course invites students who wish to
analyze bodies from different disciplinary formations—art, theatre, literature, anthropology, philosophy—and who have a particular interest in the experiential dimensions of
writing. We will read scholarly writing, fiction, New Yorker profiles, as well as memoir/autobiography, and use them as models for writing about a person or an object redolent of
a person. In the process, we will explore historiographies of the body starting in the 1970s. Possible readings: Roland Barthes on cultural theory and representation; Zine Magubane and Zadie Smith on “other people”; Tamar Garb on portraiture; Elaine Scarry on the body in pain; Joan Acocella, Hilton Als, Judith Thurman and other writers on the arts;

75

Judith Butler and Peggy Phelan on the performative body; Joseph Roach, Diana Taylor, and Michael Taussig on the body, memory, and ritual; Marvin Carlson and Terry Castle
on haunting; and Arjun Appadurai and Bill Brown on things. These will be supplemented by live performances at The ’62 Center for Theater and Dance and MASS MoCA as
well as films.
Tutorial transposed to the seminar. In the English tutorial, students are paired and alternate writing a 4- to 5-page essay based on the assignment and a 2-page response which they
read aloud to the other and the professor as a prelude to discussion. In our seminar the entire class does the same readings. Three pairs per week prepare essays and responses and
read them aloud, followed by questions, comments, and expanded discussion from the class as a whole.

ARTH 567(S) Modern/Postmodern*
This course explores cleavages and links between modernism and postmodernism, specifically as visual art discourse deploys these terms. Treating its subjects as variable
phenomena, it prioritizes the close reading of art practices; curatorial and archival models; theories of art; and salient attitudes towards the production of knowledge about art’s
past, some of which do not take the form of art history.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper of 20–25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 14. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.

ENGLISH
ARTH 568(F) Julie Ault
Julie Ault (b. 1957) is an artist best known for her work with Group Material, a New York-based collaborative active in politically engaged exhibition making in the 1980s and
1990s. In addition to her work with Group Material, her own individual practice, and collaborative projects with Martin Beck, Ault’s practice also consists of her functioning as a
writer, curator, and editor. She has written extensively on—and often in collaboration with—a number of artists and filmmakers including, among others, Sister Corita Kent,
Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Cerith Wyn Evans, James Benning, and Danh Vo. As opposed to the monographic seminar or exhibition that examines, contextualizes, and theorizes the
oeuvre of a single artist, this class will study the constellation of practices in the galaxy of Ault’s artistic and intellectual project. While this seminar’s moves from singularity to
plurality and from production to framing are familiar—and still necessary, as we will explore—poststructuralist and postmodern gestures, we will not abandon Ault to the
position of mere cipher. Though we will not attempt to unify the disparate projects under any Aultian umbrella, our analyses necessarily will force us to ask how the artist—or the
art historian, the critic, the writer, you, I—chooses the subjects of study that partially reveal how she conceives of herself as a subject. Though our primary task will be to read
critically about—and look closely at the work of—the artists and collaborative practices mentioned above, we also will pay attention to topics including: feminism, countercultures, the function of translation, the role of biography in writing art history, the history of collaborative practice, the critique of the artist, and the critique of the institutions of art.
Thinking by way of Julie Ault, we both will consider the personal nature of all critical endeavors and the heterogeneity of practices, theories, and concerns that can be organized
under any unstable proper name. Finally, and pertaining to the changing contexts of contemporary art and theoretical production after 1968, we will take seriously Walt Whitman’s famous lines: “Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself; I am large, I contain multitudes.”
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation based on class participation and three essays (2,000 words each) to be conceived in consultation with the instructor.
Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour: 10:00 a.m.-12:40 p.m. R
BRESLIN
ARTH 569(S) Film as Art: Cinema in the Weimar Republic (Same as ARTH 468)
This seminar will explore the attempt, in Weimar writing on film and film production itself, to raise the status of cinema from a low-brow mass entertainment medium to a visual
art form worthy to stand alongside traditional painting. As the critic Rudolf Arnheim argued in Film as Art (1931), “in film one continues to work with the means and devices of
traditional art, [and] one can speak just as seriously about Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, editing, and panning as one does about Titian, Cézanne, Baroque, and pleinairism.”
Among directors, F. W. Murnau studied art history at university, Fritz Lang began as a painter and sculptor in Vienna; they and other film makers availed themselves of the
services of painters and established architects for the creation of film sets. The seminar will focus precisely on this constitution of film as a primarily visual medium, in which, to
paraphrase Arnheim, the most profound content was conveyed by light, framing, physiognomy, and editing, against which the word and the often kitschy or hackneyed story line
remained secondary. While the primary focus of the film will be German directors, we shall also examine the work of filmmakers of other nationalities who were passionately
committed to raising film to the level of high art: for example, the Russian Sergei Eisenstein, whose Battleship Potemkin was a major cinema event in Germany, and the Dane
Carl Theodor Dreyer, who directed three films there.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will be responsible for oral shot analyses on segments of two films, an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semester’s
end, and a 10-minute critical commentary on another student’s oral report. Course grade is based on the final paper.
Prerequisites: none; open to seniors and graduate art history students. Others with the permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 10). Preference:seniors and
graduate students.

Students may petition to take a private tutorial by arrangement with the instructor and with permission of the Graduate Program Director.
ARTH 597(F), 598(S) Undergraduate Lecture Course Taken for Graduate Credit
LANGUAGE COURSES
The Graduate Program’s degree requirements include reading competence in two languages (other than English) of scholarly and academic relevance to the history of art. One
of the two languages must be German. Many students select French as the second although, with permission of the Director, other languages may serve. The Program offers
dedicated courses in reading French and German for art history. Other language classes at Williams are listed in the course catalog, although the coordination of undergraduate
and graduate schedules can be challenging.
Incoming students’ language preparation is assessed through exams administered at the outset of the semester. In French and German, scores attained on SAT II reading
examinations determine placement within the two-semester French/three-semester German sequence. If students attain a minimum score of 700 on the placement exam, they are
exempted from further coursework in that language. With a score between 500 and 700, they are placed into the graduate course of readings in art history, French 512 or German
513. With a score below 500, they enroll in the appropriate introductory course (French 511 or German 511/512). In the case of a second language other than French, arrangements will be made on an individual basis.
Returning students who have completed or passed out of GERM 512 may, with the prior approval of the Director and in consultation with German language faculty, satisfy the
requirement of GERM 513 by one of two alternative means: earning at least a B-, or the equivalent, in a pre-approved intensive German-language summer course; or, through
self-study, perhaps augmented by a less-rigorous summer course, successfully passing a translation exam administered by the German faculty at the beginning of their second fall
semester.

GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners (Same as GERM 111(F)-112(S))
German 511-512 is for students whose principal reason for acquiring German is to work with written materials. It is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in
which the ability to read primary and secondary texts in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and
Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of grammar and acquire a core vocabulary. In the second semester, while covering advanced grammatical topics, they
practice reading in a variety of textual genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to work with dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference works, in
both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a solid foundation for building proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work.
Credit granted only on successful completion of 512.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principal requirements: written homework, quizzes, tests, active class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to Graduate Program students, seniors and juniors.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF

RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
This course is designed to provide Graduate Program students and interested others with knowledge of French acquired through translation and interpretation. The core of this
course is based on the reading and translating of a variety of critical works covering different periods and genres in the field of art history. The material read (excerpts from
museum catalogues; the Gazette des Beaux-Arts and other publications; Salons by Diderot, Baudelaire, and Thoré; artists on their works; and critics such as Francastel, Ch.
Sterling, M. Faré, Valéry, Focillon) will be analyzed in form and content, translated or summarized, in order to develop the skills and understand the techniques necessary for
reading French accurately. Grammar will be reviewed in context.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on class participation, papers, a midterm, and a final examination.
Prerequisite: French 511 or permission of instructor; undergraduates are welcome with instructor’s permission.

ASIAN STUDIES (Div. I & II, see explanation below)
Chair, Professor KASUMI YAMAMOTO
Professors: KAGAYA, KUBLER, YAMAMOTO. Associate Professors: CHANG, NUGENT*, YU*. Visiting Assistant Professor: ABE. Visiting Lecturers: J.
CHANG, LI, YE. Affiliated Faculty: Professors: CRANE, DREYFUS, JANG, JUST*, W. A. SHEPPARD, WONG. Associate Professors: C. BOLTON, JOSEPHSON, A. REINHARDT, SINIAWER. Assistant Professors: CHAPMAN, LEE. Lecturer: GUTSCHOW. Language Fellows: CHAO, ZHANG.
The mission of the Department of Asian Studies is to help as many students as possible—both majors and non-majors—develop practical proficiency in Asian languages and,
in the tradition of the liberal arts, acquire a meaningful understanding of important facets of one or more of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies (including anthropology, art history, economics, history, linguistics, literature, music, political science, religion, and sociology), so that they may realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential
and be able to make useful contributions to society.
We offer courses in English in the field of Asian Studies as well as courses in Chinese and Japanese language, literature, and culture. Three distinct majors are offered: a major
in Chinese; a major in Japanese; and an interdisciplinary Asian Studies major which allows students to choose from a wide range of courses in the anthropology, art, economics,
history, languages, linguistics, literatures, music, politics, religion, and sociology of China, Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries. Students with questions about the Asian
Studies majors or about Asian Studies course offerings should consult the chair. Please note: Courses with ASST prefix carry Division II credit unless otherwise noted and
courses with CHIN and JAPN prefixes carry Division I credit unless otherwise noted.

THE MAJOR
All students wishing to major in the Department of Asian Studies are required to take and pass a total of eleven courses, as follows:
1) One course that explicitly compares at least two countries in Asia, such as ASST 126, ASST 201, ASST 245, ASST 250, ASST 256, ASST 269, ASST 270, or ASST 337.
Or students may take instead a course on a country that is different from their country of primary focus.
2) Four semesters of Chinese or Japanese language (including no more than two 100-level courses).
In addition to completing (1) and (2) above, all majors choose either an Area Studies track, leading to a major in Asian Studies; or a Language Studies track, leading to a
major in Chinese or Japanese. The requirements for each of these tracks are indicated below:
3A) Asian Studies Major
a. a three-course qualification in one of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies (anthropology/sociology, art history, economics, history, linguistics, literature, music,
political science, religion). The qualification, to be determined through consultation between students and their advisor, normally includes an introductory course and more
advanced courses. At least two of these three courses must be on Asia.
b. three approved electives, which may include further language work.
3B) Chinese Major
a. four additional semesters of Chinese language (300-level or higher)
b. Chinese 412
c. one approved course in Chinese literature, linguistics or culture
3C) Japanese Major
a. four additional semesters of Japanese language (300-level or higher)
b. one approved course in Japanese literature, language (400-level), or culture
c. one elective on Japan

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semesters of their junior year. Williams faculty serve on the boards of several
study abroad programs in China and Japan. Opportunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available. Prospective Asian
Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward
graduation, and up to four courses taken off campus may be counted toward the major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a proposal to the department chair before they pre-register for senior
courses in the spring of their junior year. The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for study and how the study
will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who have
maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or JAPN 493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of
their thesis shortly after spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses listed above and the award of Honors,
Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of the thesis and the student’s performance in the oral defense.

THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other programmatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for
Asian Studies established by family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), designed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The course numbering system for
Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, 402, and if appropriate, 403, 404, 405 and 406. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498)
may be offered depending on student needs and available resources. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should see the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature and culture in English translation for students who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in
Chinese literary, intellectual and cultural history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Division I unless otherwise noted.

STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Chinese are strongly encouraged to study in mainland China or Taiwan during one or both semesters of their junior year, during the summer, or over
Winter Study. It is important that students interested in any of these options consult as early as possible with the department and the Dean’s Office concerning acceptable programs.

CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese (D)
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which is the national language of China and Taiwan, and one of the official
languages of Singapore. Course objectives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in reading and writing in both the
simplified and the traditional script at about the 500-character level. The relationship between language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be
stressed throughout. Both audio and video materials will be employed extensively. This is an EDI course. Throughout the course we will address issues of how cultural differences inform and are informed by different linguistic contexts and practices.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes: oral reading, questions and discussion in Chinese, translation and
explanation in English. Evaluation is based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 12 per section).
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken. May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

CHIN 131 Basic Cantonese (Not offered 2013-2014)
An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spoken by over 60 million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, and
Guangxi as well as by many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of Hong Kong as well as the economic transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Cantonese within China has been rising steadily over the past few decades. Our focus in this course will be on developing basic
listening and speaking skills, though some attention will also be paid to written Cantonese, including the special characters which have been used for centuries to write colloquial
Cantonese. Since students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a closely related language, we should be able to cover in one semester about as much as is
covered in the first two to three semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CHIN 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).
KUBLER

CHIN 201(F), 202(S) Intermediate Chinese (D)
These two courses are designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing students’ skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and
writing. Upon completion of the courses, students should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 1000 characters (approximately 1200
common words written in both traditional and simplified characters), read materials written in simple Standard Written Chinese, and produce both orally and in writing short
compositions on everyday topics. Conducted in Mandarin. This is an EDI course. Throughout the course we will address issues of how cultural differences inform and are
informed by different linguistic contexts and practices.
Evaluation will be based on regular written and oral unit tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CHIN 102 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12 per section).

CHIN 210 Cultures of China: Conflicts and Continuities (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course provides a broad introduction to the cultures of China from earliest times to the contemporary era. The use of the plural “cultures” here is important. The notion that
Chinese culture, especially in “pre-modern” times, is a monolithic and unchanging entity is one that has been appealing to interests as diverse as Western imperialist powers and
the Chinese Communist Party. It is, however, a notion that is more fiction than fact, one story of many that can be told about the area we now call China. This course is organized
around a number of topics ranging across different periods and cultures in China, including the following: language, protest, order (and disorder), commerce, the supernatural,
reclusion, individualism, and beauty. Lectures and discussions will focus on texts from a wide range of time periods and genres, from ancient poems to modern films, from
Buddhist sutras to the writings of Mao Zedong. This course functions as an EDI course in a number of ways. Throughout, we will compare the different cultures broadly
considered Chinese to understand the ways in which they interacted, influenced each other, and came into conflict. We will also examine issues of power and privilege as we
analyze how different interests used cultural structures and products to gain and maintain their power in society. No previous knowledge of China or Chinese expected. All
readings in English.
Format: lecture. Requirements: short response papers, two longer papers (1700-2300 words), and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25). Preference given to Chinese and History majors.

CHIN 219 Popular Culture in Modern China (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course adopts a generic approach to introducing students to a variety of forms of popular culture in modern and contemporary China. The forms of popular culture studied
include popular readings (fiction, newspapers, magazines), advertisements, propaganda posters, popular music, television shows, film, and popular religious movements. We
will explore such themes as the definitions of “popular culture,” globalization and cultural trends, the encoding and decoding strategies of a popular “text,” as well as the political,
ideological and sociological messages behind a popular “text.” All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance, in-class participation, oral presentations, two short response papers, and one final research paper.
No prerequisites; open to all. No Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language background are encouraged to work with Chinese sources if they wish.
Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to Chinese or Asian Studies majors, and then to sophomores and juniors.

CHIN 223 Ethnic Minorities in China: Past and Present (Same as ANTH 223) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
By 2000, of the 1.3 billion population of China, more than 100 million were ethnic minorities (shaoshu minzu). Most of the minority groups reside in autonomous regions and
districts, which constitute 64% of China’s total acreage. This course introduces students to the multiethnic aspect of China’s past and present. We will address topics such as the
minority-group identification project; the definition of minzu; government policy toward and the current situation of the fifty-five official ethnic minority groups; historical
sino-centric views about “foreigners” and “barbarians”; ideas of “diversity”, “unity”, and “sinicization”; and the roles that “barbarians” have played in China’s long history. All
readings will be in English.
This is an EDI course. We will explore various meanings of “diversity” and “being ethnic” in the Chinese context and compare them with students’ own experiences through
class discussions and an essay assignment.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance, in-class participation and presentations, two short response papers, one mid-term, and one final paper.
No prerequisites. No knowledge of Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language background are encouraged to work with Chinese sources if they wish.
Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference is given to Chinese and Asian Studies majors, and then to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.

CHIN 228 Traditional Chinese Poetry (Same as COMP 225) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
Poetry was the dominant form of literature in China for most of the pre-modern period. It could be used to justify the overthrow of dynasties or to court a beloved; Chinese poets
sang about communing with the gods and about brewing ale, sometimes in the same poem. In this course we will read and discuss poems from the first 2000 years of the Chinese
literary tradition. Some of the issues we will explore include the ways in which poems present the world and make arguments about it; how Chinese poets construct different
notions of the self through their poems; and how poetry can give voice to conflicts between aesthetics and morality, between the self and the community, and between the state
and other sources of social capital. We will also look at Chinese theories of literature and poetry and compare them with dominant Western models. This is an EDI course and we
will be concerned throughout with differences in the way Chinese and other cultures thought about and utilized poetry. We will examine the implicit biases inherent in the ways

79

Western scholars in particular have analyzed and translated Chinese poetry. All readings in English translation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: numerous short response papers, two longer papers (1700-2300 words), and a final exam; participation in class discussions required.
No prerequisites; no previous experience with poetry or Chinese required; open to all. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to Chinese majors.
NUGENT
CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese (D)
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students’
reading proficiency in standard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written Chinese which was introduced during the
first two years of instruction. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin. This is an EDI course. In addition to involving immersion in a
classroom Chinese environment, much of our focus will be on the ways that various cultural issues are perceived and addressed differently (and, in many instances, in similar
ways) in China and the US.
Requirements: drill/discussion/reading. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, short essays, homework, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CHIN 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: none (expected: 15). Preference given to Chinese majors.

CHIN 352 Bridging Theory and Practice: Learning and Teaching Chinese as a Second Language (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course introduces students to the principles of second language acquisition (SLA), a field of study that investigates how people learn a foreign language and provides a basis
for understanding research related to foreign language learning and teaching. Theoretical issues to be covered include what it means to know a language, how one becomes
proficient in a foreign language, factors that affect the learning process, and the role of one’s native language. We will also examine what SLA research has discovered about
teaching grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, and writing. The goal is to explore ways in which SLA theories can be applied to facilitate acquisition of Chinese in terms of
learning strategies and curriculum design. This course will be useful to both students who want to improve their own learning of Chinese and those who plan to teach or conduct
research on Chinese. All readings in English with some examples in Chinese.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several oral presentations and short papers, and a final research project.
Prerequisites: CHIN 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15).

(for speaking/comprehension) audiotapes, videotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of society; and (for reading) newspaper and magazine articles
dealing with Chinese politics and economics as well as selections from modern Chinese literature. Conducted in Mandarin. This is an EDI course. In addition to involving
immersion in a classroom Chinese environment, much of our focus will be on the ways that various cultural issues are perceived and addressed differently (and, in many
instances, in similar ways) in China and the US.

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese
Classical or “Literary” Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh century BC until the 1920s and served for many centuries as an important
written language in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g., newspaper,
road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). This course will serve as an introduction to the basic grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese.
We will focus on philosophical, political, and historical anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 B.C.) through the Han Dynasty (202 B.C.-220
A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While the main objective is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to enhance
proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and
Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar. Conducted primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CHIN 302 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

CHIN 413 Intermediate Classical Chinese: Ideas of Authority in Classical Chinese Literature (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course builds on the base of vocabulary and grammar established in Chinese 412 to introduce students to a much broader range of Classical Chinese texts and genres. The
works we will read include poetic, philosophical, and historical texts that all deal in some way with evolving ideas of authority in the Chinese tradition. Our focus in this course
will be not only on careful translation and grammatical analysis of these texts, but also on the ideas they express and the different rhetorical and linguistic modes they use to
construct their arguments. Students will also be introduced to the major dictionaries and other resources for reading and translating Classical Chinese. All primary readings will
be in Classical Chinese. Translation will be primarily into English and classroom discussion will be in English. However, students are expected to have sufficient proficiency in
modern Chinese to read commentaries and notes on the texts written in that language.
Format: translation and discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CHIN 412 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected:15).

CHIN 431 Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Not offered 2013-2014)
Is Chinese—whose nouns “lack” number and whose verbs have no tense—a monosyllabic, “primitive” language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical symbols or
“ideographs,” which indicate meaning directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with and alphabetized? Are Cantonese, Hakka, and
Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the relationship between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of the questions we will be taking up in this
one-semester introduction to the scientific study of the Chinese language. Topics to be covered include: the phonological, syntactical, and lexical structure of Modern Standard
Chinese; the Chinese writing system; the modern Chinese dialects; the history of the Chinese language; sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; and language and politics in the
Chinese-speaking countries. Readings in English and Chinese, with class discussion primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer paper.

STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Japanese are encouraged to consider study in Japan at some point in their Williams career-during one or both semesters of their junior year, during the
summer, or over Winter Study. It is important that students interested in any of these options consult carefully with the department and the Dean’s Office starting at an early date.
JAPN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Elementary Japanese (D)
An introduction to modern spoken and written Japanese, the course aims to instill proficiency in Japanese by developing four necessary skills of speaking, listening, reading, and
writing to successfully interact with native speakers. The relationship between language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed
throughout. Audio, video and computer-assisted learning materials will be used extensively. Classes consist of a combination of ”act” classes, conducted exclusively in Japanese,
where students use the language in various types of drills and communicative activities, and ”fact” classes, conducted in Japanese and English, where students learn about the
language and culture. This is an EDI course. Throughout the course we will address issues of how cultural difference inform and are informed by different linguistic contexts and
practices.
Format: Fact classes, three hours per week. Act classes three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes, a midterm, and a

JAPN 271 Transitional Japanese Literature into the Twentieth Century (Same as COMP 269) (Not offered 2013-2014)
After more than two centuries of National Seclusion, Japan’s modern era began suddenly in the middle of the nineteenth century, with the unexpected arrival of Commodore
Perry, the destabilization of the 250-year old shogunal government, and the violent restoration of Imperial rule. Rapid and radical changes followed in every aspect of society,
from fashion to philosophy. This course will explore how such changes have been expressed through literature, film and performance. We will trace how the authors of literary
and other artistic works perceived, integrated and at times rejected experiences of the new and the foreign. All readings and discussions will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on active class participation, presentations, written journals, two short and one longer paper.

about Japanese society. Through literature and other media, we will probe domestic issues, such as bullying, suicide, reclusion and gender inequality, and international issues, related to Japan’s shifting role within East Asia. Discussions will untangle the conflicting perspectives, and elaborate the thoughts and feelings of
the various contestants. All readings and discussions will be in English. Some course materials will also be available in Japanese, for those interested. As this
tutorial actively explores diversity of human thought, and the contexts that create such diversity, this is an EDI course.

JAPN 276 Premodern Japanese Literature and Performance (Same as COMP 278) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Some of Japan’s performance traditions, which developed in different historical settings, have survived to this day and continue to coexist and compete for the attention of
audiences both domestically and abroad. This course examines the Japanese literature of three major periods in Japan’s history, focusing on how literary and performance traditions have been interrelated in the unfolding of Japanese literary history. We will begin by looking into the Heian period (794-1185), when the work of female authors occupied
center stage and some of the canonical texts of the Japanese literary and cultural tradition were born. Next we will consider the medieval period (1185-1600), which saw the rise

81

of the samurai class and the consequent shift in the domain of artistic creation. Then we will look at the Edo period (1600-1867), when a new bourgeois culture flourished and
audiences were greatly transformed. We will also explore the continuing force of premodern literary traditions in contemporary performing arts. All readings and discussions will
be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two essay questions, one paper, and attendance of live performance events.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

JAPN 405 Thematic Reading and Writing in Japanese I (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course is designed for the advanced students of Japanese who want to develop their reading and writing skills intensively. Students will be exposed to various genres of
readings on the themes of modern and pre-modern Japanese society in contrast to those of the U.S. Research and writing skills will be developed in conjunction with student
projects. This course also aims to develop a high level of speaking proficiency through discussion and narrative discourse. This is an EDI course because students are immersed
in a Japanese environment in class and will learn how to express their ideas and opinions using Japanese discourse patterns both in texts and dialogues. This requires reflective

ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES
Advisory Committee: Professors: Scott Wong (Coordinator), Dorothy Wang, Vincent Schleitwiler, Ji-Young Um
As an intellectual interdisciplinary field, Asian American Studies provides a valuable critique of American history, society, and culture by exploring its critical influence on the
construction of American society and culture. Moreover, Asian American Studies provides a unique lens for understanding the United States as a whole. Through its development of different perspectives on class, gender, and race in the United States, Asian American Studies forces us to re-examine American society as well as the United States’
ongoing military and economic links to Asia.
Clearly, the broad array of relevant classes in this field allows students to develop new critical, analytical, and investigative means for understanding American national
narratives and the United States’ rapidly changing ethnic makeup. The field covers a history of more than 150 years and encompasses such diverse academic disciplines as
sociology, English, women’s, gender, and sexuality studies, history, law, art, political science, and philosophy among other fields. A survey of Asian American Studies at Williams College includes courses spanning across the humanities and social sciences. Below is a list of suggested courses for students interested in establishing a foundation in this
course of study at Williams College.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Lecturer: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? How do we discover Earth-like planets among the many circling other stars? How did the universe begin and how has it evolved over its 13.7
billion year history? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as it
does and how the Universe behaves. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is interested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to
follow new astronomical discoveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astrophysics major (administered jointly with the
Physics Department) and the Astronomy major are described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range courses are intended primarily for non-science majors and have no
prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is designed for students with some exposure to physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a
co–requisite of Mathematics 140 or equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities including a 24-inch computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic
detectors, and our own computer network for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at web.williams.edu/astronomy.

ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, including not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or
a closely related area, but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Astrophysics alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists, geologists, teachers,
doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics, English, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics
majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate route through the major. An essential ingredient in
such students’ undergraduate training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the first year a student is at Williams with Physics
131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 140 or 150 or 151 in the fall. Students with very good background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 140 may choose to
take Physics 201 and Mathematics 150 or 151 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the fall of their first
year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics; those who place out of
Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and computer science may also be appropriate.

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is eleven. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 140 and/or 150 or 151 taken elsewhere, but at least 8 courses in astronomy,

83

physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this relation,
certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics
and Physics.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade requirements (other than College-wide
requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both
ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor
early in the second semester of their junior year and usually begin their thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been
approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course
(Astrophysics 493) and the winter study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in consultation with each student,
whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be
awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high
distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study
project over and above the minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with advanced standing and/or summer research
experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.

ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics and
math courses of the astrophysics major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major emphasizes understanding the
observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy,
to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major
requires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with
members of the department early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take not only Astronomy 111 but
also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 140 (if necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under
Physics.

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they form? Astronomy 101, a non–major, general introduction to the part of
contemporary astronomy that includes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more. The course gives special attention to
the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X–ray Observatory, the Kepler
mission to discover extrasolar planets, the new generation of 8– and 10–meter mountaintop telescopes, results from them, and their even–larger planned successors of 30–meter–
diameter equivalents; how astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern
understanding of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes result from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how
supermassive black holes lurk at the center of galaxies and quasars. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. We regularly discuss the latest news
briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of and on the same level as Astronomy 102 (solar system)
and 104 (galaxies and cosmology), and students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24–inch telescope and other telescopes for nighttime observations of stars, star clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies,
as well as use of other telescopes for daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs (five times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.

ASTR 104 The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond (Not offered 2013-2014)
It has been less than a century since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the Milky Way Galaxy was determined to be only one of
countless “island universes” in space. A host of technological advances is enabling us to understand even more clearly our place in the universe and how the universe began. For
example, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Herschel Space Observatory, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory bring clearer images and cover a wider range of the spectrum than
has ever been obtainable before; they are speeding up progress on determining the past and future of the Universe. They are confirming and enlarging our understanding of the
Big Bang. In addition, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck spacecraft’s study of the early Universe and large-scale mapping programs such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey are giving clues into how the Universe’s currently observed structure arose. Astronomy 104, a non-major, general introduction to part of contemporary
astronomy comprising the study of galaxies and the Universe, explores the answers to questions like: What is the Milky Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe
made largely of “dark matter” and “dark energy”?; What determines the ultimate fate of the Universe? How have studies of Cepheid variables and distant supernovae with the
Hubble Space Telescope determine that the Universe is 13.7 billion years old and indicated that the Universe’s expansion is accelerating. We regularly discuss the latest news
briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of, and on the same level as Astronomy 101 and 102, and

ASTR 336 Science, Pseudoscience, and the Two Cultures (Same as HSCI 336) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
A famous dichotomy between the sciences and the humanities, and public understanding of them, was laid down by C. P. Snow and has been widely discussed, with ignorance of
the second law of thermodynamics compared with ignorance of Shakespeare. In this seminar, we will consider several aspects of science and scientific culture, including how
scientific thinking challenges the claims of pseudoscience. We will consider C. P. Snow and his critics as well as the ideas about the Copernican Revolution and other paradigms
invented by Thomas Kuhn. We will discuss the recent “Science Wars” over the validity of scientific ideas. We will consider the fundamental originators of modern science,
including Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, viewing their original works in the Chapin Library of rare books and comparing their interests in science with what we now call
pseudoscience, like alchemy. We will review the history and psychology of astrology and other pseudosciences. Building on the work of Martin Gardner in Fads and Fallacies in
the Name of Science, and using the current journal The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, we consider from a scientific point of view what is now called complementary
or alternative medicine, including both versions such as chiropractic, osteopathy, and homeopathy, and newer nonscientific practices. We will discuss the current global-climatechange deniers and their effects on policy. We consider such topics as GM (genetically modified) foods, the safety and regulation of dietary supplements, and the validity of
government and other recommendations relevant to the roles of dietary salt and fat in health. We consider the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and reports of UFO’s
and aliens. We consider the possible effects that superstitious beliefs have on the general public’s cooperation in vaccination programs and other consequences of superstition. We
also consider the recently increased range of dramas that are based on scientific themes, such as Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia and Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on biweekly 5-page papers, participation in discussions, and a 15-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference will be given to juniors and seniors and to those with backgrounds in science, history of science, or philosophy.

ASTR 402 Between the Stars: The Interstellar Medium (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The matter between the stars—the interstellar medium—manifests itself in many interesting and unexpected ways, and, as the detritus of stars, its properties and behavior hold
clues to the history and future evolution of both stars and the galaxies that contain them. Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter all through their lifetimes, from their birthplaces
in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject with varying ferocity as they evolve, to their final fates as they shed their outer layers, whether as planetary nebulae or
dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the products of the stars’ nuclear fusion. The existence of life on Earth is eloquent
evidence of this chemical enrichment.
In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe from diffuse
matter, including radiative ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of “forbidden” lines, collisional ionization, and synchrotron radiation. This course is observing-intensive. Throughout the semester students will work in small groups to design, carry out, analyze, and critique their own observations of the interstellar medium using the
equipment on our observing deck.
Format: seminar/discussion, plus computer work and observing projects. Evaluation will be based on homework, class presentations/problem-solving, and observing projects.

ASTR 410 Compact Stellar Remnants: White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars and Black Holes (Not offered 2013-2014)
A star is a very interesting, very complicated physical object. Properties of stars and their evolutionary paths depend on an intricate interplay of different physical phenomena with
gravity, nuclear interactions, radiation processes and even quantum and relativistic effects playing important roles. Using basic physics we will construct simple models of stars

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and knowledge from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at the intersection of the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biological data that are being generated from the
sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and answer biological questions that have long been considered too complex to address. Research in genomics,
proteomics, and bioinformatics will also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, economics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments
and was designed to provide students with an understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level courses, Computation and biology and
Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in gaining familiarity with the power of genomic analysis. Students interested in graduate work in bioinformatics,
genomics, and proteomics should take the core courses and five of the recommended courses. Interested students are also encouraged to participate in independent research with
members of the advisory faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elucidation of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields of molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, “intelligent” drug design, “in vitro evolution”), genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunology, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and
molecular biology are at the interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily from these disciplines. While
chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and molecular biology probe
the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually
and as members of more complex structures.

PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in
mind, the program has been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many facets of the modern areas of the
biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry
321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at
Williams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in
those fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses
in mathematics and physics.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 401, the capstone course for the concentration, provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of BIMO-related research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I—Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as BIOL 321 and CHEM 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structures of proteins
and nucleic acids are examined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures. Other topics covered
include catalysis, enzyme kinetics, mechanism and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes; and the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins. In
addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed. The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis, chromatography, and principles of enzymatic assays. Does not satisfy the distribution requirement in the Biology major
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on quizzes, a midterm exam, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the

alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmentalization and the
transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis
and catabolism of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways. Does not satisfy the distribution requirement in the Biology major

To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the required courses listed below, take at least one elective in
biology and one elective in chemistry from the list below, and attend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry Department
counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors (each of which can be completed with only eight other
courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

Colloquium Requirement
Concentrators must attend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. The Biology and Chemistry Departments hold colloquia on Friday afternoons during
the fall and spring semesters. Scientists from other academic or research institutions are invited to present their research to students and faculty. There are approximately a dozen
colloquia offered each semester among which BIMO concentrators may choose. Attendance at the honors student research presentations and the BIMO Alumni Reunion poster
session also count toward the colloquium requirement. Concentrators may receive credit for colloquia attended during any of their semesters at Williams College.

BIOLOGY (Div. III)
Professors: ALTSCHULER*, ART, J. EDWARDS, D. LYNCH, SAVAGE, SWOAP, WILLIAMS***, ZOTTOLI***. Associate Professors: BANTA, MORALES, TING*. Senior Lecturer: D. C. SMITH. Assistant Professors: LEBESTKY, MAROJA*, CARTER. Visiting Assistant Professor: ENGEL. Professor of
Marine Science for the Williams-Mystic Program: CARLTON. Lecturer: DEAN, MACINTIRE.
The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding principles governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell
biology to physiology to ecology and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all sub-disciplines including the coupling of structure to function, the transfer of
energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent and honors research, students have
the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate
studies in the life sciences and in the health professions.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:

Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry

NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or 400-level course requirements. WIOX 316, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualifies for major credit at the 200-level.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at
levels of organization above the cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.

COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also
possible to begin the Biology major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more biology courses during several
semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take
Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204 Animal Behavior and Biology 220 Field Botany without prerequisite. Other 100-level biology courses are designed specifically for students
who do not intend to take additional upper-level courses in biology. All of these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on
the College Board Biology Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or Biology 102 upon successful completion
of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First Days.

COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergraduate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at
least one semester of mathematics (a course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the requirements for graduate admission at
relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology Department’s graduate school advisor about prerequisites for admission to graduate programs.

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology
majors interested in this field are strongly encouraged to enroll in Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).

NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.

88

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Environmental Studies.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of
independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee
of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and skills,
ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation. Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the
department early in the spring semester of the junior year; approval must be received before spring registration in the junior year. The number of Biology Department faculty
available to mentor research students and the number of students each can accommodate in her/his lab vary from year to year. Although the department will make every effort to
provide an opportunity for students to conduct Honors research, you should be aware that it may not be possible to assign all applicants to a laboratory.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (each of which must have a
laboratory associated with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or any other one course and two
semesters of Organic Chemistry). Note: A student who has a double major cannot count any course twice. For example, if a student is a Biology and Chemistry major, Organic
Chemistry can only be counted in one of the two majors.
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the
option, subject to the approval of their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester junior year. In general, thesis
students who start during WSP or spring semester of their junior year are working on a project that requires winter or spring field work. Students beginning honors in winter study
of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students beginning honors during the second
semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior year.

STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on majoring in Biology are strongly advised to take Biology 202 before going abroad, since Biology 202 is required for the major and a prerequisite for
many upper-level courses; a Genetics course taken while studying away cannot substitute for Biology 202. Biology majors studying abroad may receive credit toward the major
for at most two 200-level electives; the departmental distribution requirement can be satisfied through an appropriate course taken during study abroad. Students should meet
with the Department Chair to discuss study abroad options.

CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives towards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology
Department Chair.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with courses taken at other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the
Biology Department, prior to registering for the course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a review of the course syllabi and the transcripts of the relevant
previous college work, and students should bring these materials with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell

BIOL 132 The Human Genome (Not offered 2013-2014)
An ambitious plan was launched in 1988 to determine the DNA sequence of the human genome. That project was “completed” in 2001—but that was really only the beginning.
Sequencing of additional genomes goes on, but, more importantly, scientists and society are putting considerable effort into trying to understand what all those A’s, G’s, C’s, and
T’s mean. Lectures will acquaint students with the fundamentals of human DNA research and its applications in the fields of medicine, human evolution, and biotechnology. The
implications of this research for individuals and for society as a whole will be addressed in readings and discussions. Does not satisfy the distribution requirement for the Biology
major. Does not count for major credit in Biology.

Intended for the non-scientist, this course explores the biological dimensions of social issues in tropical societies, and focuses on specifically on the peoples and cultures of
tropical regions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceanea, and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many social issues in the tropics are
inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major climatic and habitat
features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course
covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of
humans with their supporting ecological environment. Does not count for major credit in Biology. Does not satisfy the distribution requirement for the Biology major.
This course fulfills the EDI requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social issues in the tropics from the perspective of biologist. This builds a
framework for life long exploration of human diversity.
Format: lecture/debate, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a short paper, panel preparation, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: none. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60). Preference given to seniors, juniors, sophomores, and first-year students—in that order.

BIOL 136 Studying Human Genetic Diversity: Individuals, Populations, and ‘Races’—Dangerous Biology (D) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Scientists are rapidly acquiring DNA sequence information on thousands of individuals from a wide variety of human populations. This information can be used to illuminate human history and evolution. It can also be used in the field of medicine to develop new drugs and as a first step toward tailoring treatments to match individuals’
genomes. This information can also create new ethical and social dilemmas. Do such studies support or refute the idea of a biological basis for ’race’? Can the data be used
to justify societal inequities? Do the data have any use outside of scientific circles? Through reading scientific articles we’ll explore genome sequencing data to determine
the types of DNA differences that exist among humans. We’ll examine the data in the light of human population history (migration, population bottlenecks, selection) to
understand how these variations come about. Throughout we’ll discuss the implications of these studies for individuals and for society. In particular we’ll critique the use of
such information in guiding policy and practice in areas such as genetic screening and eugenics, ancestry testing, ‘race-based’ medicine, forensics.
As an EDI course, we’ll examine issues of power and privilege in shaping practice and policy associated with these genetic initiatives, such as in deciding what populations

89

to study, in administering informed consent, and in addressing health disparities.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one exam, one short paper (4-6 pages), final paper (10-12 pages); class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to juniors, sophomores, seniors, first-years; not open to students who have taken BIOL 202 or
BIOL132. Does not count for major credit in Biology. Does not satisfy the distribution requirement for the Biology major.

BIOL 204 Animal Behavior (Not offered 2013-2014)
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a discipline that draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations can be found on
many levels: evolutionary theory tells us why certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us understand how those patterns are implemented, neuroscience
gives insights as to how the world appears to the behaving animal, endocrinology provides information on how suites of behaviors are regulated. The first part of the course
focuses upon how descriptive studies provide the basis for formulating questions about behavior as well as the statistical methods used to evaluate the answers to these questions.
We then consider the behavior of individuals, both as it is mediated by biological mechanisms and as it appears from an evolutionary perspective. The second half of the course is
primarily concerned with the behaviors of groups of animals from a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, concentrating upon the stimuli, responses, and internal
mechanisms that maintain social systems and on the selection pressures that drive animals toward a particular social system.

BIOL 218T DNA, Life and Everything (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Since the molecular biology revolution of the 1960s, a view of biology has developed which regards living organisms as predictable products of their encoded DNA programs. A
motto for this philosophy and scientific approach could be ”To know my DNA is to know me.” In this tutorial we’ll examine the power and the limitations of DNA analysis and
manipulation for understanding life. Students will read and discuss scientific articles that deal with creating artificial life (the field of synthetic biology), environmental DNA
sampling (to deduce community structure; to discover new, uncultured species), human genome diversity surveys (to discover the basis for human phenotypic variation and
human evolutionary history), comparative genomics to address evolutionary questions (ex., chimps and Neanderthals compared to humans), and resurrecting extinct organisms.

BIOL 219T Dangerous Exposures: Environment, Immunity, and Infectious Disease (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Global reports of emerging infectious diseases and old diseases with new pathogenic properties incite fears for personal safety as well as national security. The specter of a
contagious pandemic has captured the public imagination through the mass news media, movies, and even popular on-line and board games. In this tutorial course, we will
explore the ecology and evolution of several recently emergent diseases such as SARS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and AIDS. Topics to be considered include transmission
dynamics, epidemiological modeling of vaccination strategies, and wildlife reservoirs that contribute to human virus exposure. We will examine progress in preventing the
parasitic diseases malaria and sleeping sickness in Africa and why these diseases have proven so refractory. We will also discuss the science behind the recent development of the
vaccine against the human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, and the intriguing and highly unusual transmissible cancers in dogs and Tasmanian devils. Finally, we
will think about the contributions of inadequate diagnostic capacities world-wide and broader issues of resource shortages in driving the global emergence of drug resistance in

BIOL 308 Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers (Not offered 2013-2014)
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all life. Successful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural ecosystems depends on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, develop, and respond to their environment. This
course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using an integrative approach that considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their environment. Major emphasis
will be on understanding fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and development, water transport, hormone physiology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organismal level. Environmental effects on these processes will be addressed in topics including photomorphogenesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plantmicrobe interactions. Discussions of original research papers will examine the mechanisms plants use to perform these processes and explore advances in the genetic engineering
of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical purposes. Laboratory activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiological processes.

BIOL 310(S) Neural Development and Plasticity (Same as NSCI 310)
Development can be seen as a tradeoff between genetically-determined processes and environmental stimuli. The tension between these two inputs is particularly apparent in the
developing nervous system, where many events must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response to environmental conditions, is also essential.
Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation proceed, and the potential for regeneration after injury or disease in adults is limited; however some exceptions to this rule

exist, and recent data suggest that the nervous system is not hard-wired as previously thought. In this course we will discuss the mechanisms governing nervous system development, from relatively simple nervous systems such as that of the roundworm, to the more complicated nervous systems of humans, examining the roles played by genetically
specified programs and non-genetic influences.

BIOL 315(S) Microbiology: Diversity, Cellular Physiology, and Interactions
Bioterrorism and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria are but two of the reasons for the resurgence of interest in the biology of microorganisms. This course will
examine microbes from the perspectives of cell structure and function, genomics, and evolution. A central theme will be the adaptation of bacteria as they evolve to fill specific
ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe:host interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will consider communication among bacteria as well as between bacteria and their
environment. Topics include: microbial development, population dynamics, metagenomics, bioremediation, plant and animal defenses against infection, and bacterial strategies
to subvert the immune system. In the lab, major projects will focus on horizontal gene transfer, metagenomics, and the isolation and characterization of bacteria from natural
environments. Students will also use flow cytometry to investigate fundamental aspects of the mammalian immune system. The lab experience will culminate in multi-week
independent investigations. Readings will be supplemented by articles from the primary literature.

What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics program, computational analysis and
wet–lab investigations will inform each other, as students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics contribute their own expertise to
explore how ever–growing gene and protein data–sets can provide key insights into human disease. In this course, we will take advantage of one well–studied system, the highly
conserved Ras–related family of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will integrate bioinformatics and molecular
biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, phylogenetics, and recombinant DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of gene families by focusing
on the gene duplication events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through–put approaches to investigate
genes involved in the MAPK signal transduction pathway in human colon cancer cell lines, students will uncover regulatory mechanisms that are aberrantly altered by siRNA
knockdown of putative regulatory components. This functional genomic strategy will be coupled with independent projects using phosphorylation–state specific antisera to test
our hypotheses. Proteomic analysis will introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data–mining approaches and Bayesian
modeling of protein network dynamics in single cells. Flow cytometry and mass spectrometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in colon tumor cells.

BIOL 405T(F) Sociobiology (W)
Sociobiology, or the study of social behavior, has challenged the limits of evolutionary theory since Darwin described the non-reproducing castes among social insects (i.e.,
eusociality) as ”one special difficulty.” Inclusive fitness theory and Hamilton’s rule--that an altruistic act can evolve where the benefit to related individuals exceeds the cost to the
actor--potentially resolves Darwin’s paradox. Nevertheless, explanations including delayed fitness benefits and ecological constraints have been suggested as alternatives to

92

inclusive fitness theory. Moreover, the theoretical justification for inclusive fitness theory has recently been vigorously challenged. This course will use readings from the primary
literature to examine the evidence for inclusive fitness as a potential explanation for topics including the evolution of helping behavior, eusociality and its relationship to extraordinary sex ratios, and spiteful behavior. Other topics that we will cover include the evolution of deceit and self deception.

BIOL 406(S) Dynamics of Internal Membrane Systems
Eukaryotic cells build and maintain a diverse set of internal membrane compartments that control the functionality of proteins at the cell surface and allow the cell to create
immensely disparate internal chemical environnments. Despite a high rate of exchange between the constituents of this interconnected and dynamic membrane system, it has
become apparent that compartmental identity (i.e. a unique set of protein constituents) can be established by regulated cargo selection and membrane fusion reactions. This

BIOL 414 Life at Extremes: Molecular Mechanisms (Not offered 2013-2014)
All organisms face variability in their environments, and the molecular and cellular responses to stresses induced by environmental change often illuminate otherwise hidden
facets of normal physiology. Moreover, many organisms have evolved unique molecular mechanisms, such as novel cellular compounds or macromolecular structural modifications, which contribute to their ability to survive continuous exposure to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or low pH. This course will examine how chaperonins,
proteases, and heat- and cold-shock proteins are regulated in response to changes in the external environment. We will then consider how these and other molecular mechanisms
function to stabilize DNA and proteins—and, ultimately, cells and organisms. Other extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, snow fields, hypersaline lakes, the intertidal zone, and acid springs provide further examples of cellular and molecular responses to extreme conditions. Biotechnological applications of these molecular mechanisms in areas such as protein engineering will also be considered. Class discussions will focus upon readings from the primary literature.

BIOL 416 Epigenetics (Not offered 2013-2014)
After decades of studies emphasizing the role of DNA in heredity, scientists are now turning their attention from genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that fall under
the heading of epigenetics, heritable changes that do not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell function can result from, for
example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA methylation, or the location of a molecule within the cell. Using readings from the primary
literature, we will explore the epigenetic nature and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena such as prion propagation, genetic imprinting, dosage
compensation, transvection, centromere formation, synapse function, and programmed genome rearrangements. The significance of epigenetic processes for development,
evolution, and human health will be discussed.

BIOL 418(F) From Signal Transduction to Cancer
Division of normal cells is a highly regulated process based on input from both intrinsic and extrinsic signals. The cell’s response to its environment affects all aspects of cell
behavior: proliferation, death, differentiation and migration. The goal of the course is to understand the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction that guide normal cell
behavior and how disruptions in this process can lead to cancer. We will focus on the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway that is activated in 30% of all known cancers. Genetic
studies will serve as an introduction to the components of the pathway, followed by an examination of the molecular mechanisms of signal reception, transduction of intracellular
information, scaffolding and transcriptional targets. The final section of the course will investigate how high throughput screens, medicinal chemistry studies and mouse models
are used to identify small molecular inhibitors of pathway components. We will consider the effectiveness of these inhibitors in pharmacological studies, clinical trials and
potential cancer treatments.

BIOL 426T Frontiers in Muscle Physiology: Controversies (W) (Not offered 2013-2014)
While an active muscle produces force, contraction of muscle is far from the only function of this intriguing organ system. Muscle plays a major role in metabolic regulation of organisms, acts as a glucose storage facility, regulates blood pressure in mammals, and produces numerous hormones. The mechanism for contractile activity varies
not only among different organisms, but also among different muscles within the same organism. Controversies, disagreements, and arguments pervade the muscle biology
literature perhaps because of the integrative nature of the science. In this tutorial course, we will utilize molecular, physiological, comparative, and evolutionary aspects of
muscle biology to address current controversies of this dynamic tissue. Some questions that will be addressed include: 1) Lactic acid generated by skeletal muscle is / is not
involved with fatigue at high exercise intensity, 2) Satellite cells are / are not obligatory for skeletal muscle hypertrophy, 3) Do mammals possess the same “stretch activation” of skeletal muscle as seen in insect flight muscle?, 4) Are smooth and skeletal muscles from the same lineage of cells, or do they represent convergent evolution on
the tissue level? After an initial group meeting, students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and the instructor for an hour each week. Every other week at this tutorial meeting, students present a written and oral critical analysis of the assigned research articles. Students not making a presentation question and critique the work of their colleague.
Format: tutorial meeting one hour a week. Evaluation is based on five tutorial papers of four pages each, five critiques, tutorial presentations, and general participation.
Prerequisite: BIOL 205. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference will be given to biology majors who have not had a 400-level biology course.

BIOL 430T Genome Sciences: At the Cutting Edge (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Research in genomics has integrated and revolutionized the field of biology, including areas of medicine, plant biology, microbiology, and evolutionary biology. Moreover, recent
developments in “metagenomics” (genomic studies of entire communities of microorganisms in natural environments, such as the mammalian gut and the deep sea) and “metatranscriptomics” (studies of genome wide changes in expression and mRNA levels in natural communities of organisms) have generated unprecedented knowledge about the
genomic potential of a community and the in situ biological activity of different ecological niches. In this course we will explore how research in these and related areas, including
proteomics, have advanced our fundamental understanding of (1) organisms in the three domains of life, and their interactions and evolutionary relationships; (2) biological
systems and environments, such as the human body, extreme environments, and the oceans; (3) strategies for solving global challenges in medicine, agriculture, energy resources, and environmental sciences. During the course, students will meet each week for one hour with a tutorial partner and the instructor. Every other week, students will
present a written and oral critical analysis of the assigned research articles. On alternate weeks, students will question/critique the work of their colleague.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on five (4-5 page) papers, tutorial presentations, and the student’s effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: BIOL 202; open to juniors and seniors. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to senior Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportunity for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an
area of important achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become aware of the special viewpoint of
chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and something of their significance within the fields of
science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole. The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering,
environmental science, materials science, medicine, and the medical sciences.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student’s first year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a
foundation in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that is consistent with his or her
background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student’s program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with
additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and materials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with a member of the
department as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and which makes full use of their previous preparation.
All students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental
placement test results and consultation with the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam are also taken into account.
The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level, students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who
complete 155 are exempted from 256). Completion of a Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry courses plus two approved
courses from among the following: Biology 101; Computer Science 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105, 106; Physics 131, 141; or any courses in these departments for which the
approved courses are prerequisites. CHEM 155 counts for two courses toward the major, but a single course toward graduation credit. Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the
courses taken must have a laboratory component, and at least one must be selected from Chemistry 361, 366, 364, or 367. (The specific course elected, in consultation with the
chair or major advisor, will depend on the student’s future plans.) In addition, the department has a number of “Independent Research Courses” which, while they do not count
toward completion of the major, provide a unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests and possible continuation of their studies at the graduate level, the
following groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 326, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 367. Students interested in biochemistry
should consult with Professors Blair, Gehring, Kaplan, Lovett, or Taurog.
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 343, Chemistry 344T, Chemistry 348, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 366. Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Professors Blair, S. Goh, Richardson, or Smith.
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 335, Chemistry 336, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368T. Students interested in physical
chemistry should consult with Professors Bingemann, Peacock-López, or Thoman. Students interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Professor C. Goh or
Park. Students interested in materials science should consult with Professors C. Goh or Park.
While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in chemistry, four electives should be considered a minimum,
and at least a semester of research is strongly recommended.
The department’s curriculum is approved by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of academic, industrial, and research chemists. The
A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256,
321, 335, 364, 361 (366 or 367) and at least 4 courses (two of which must have a laboratory component) from our remaining upper level electives: 319, 322,
324, 326, 336, 341, 342, 343, 344T, 348, 361, 366, 367, 368T, 493, 494, 497, 498, BIMO 401. In addition, students are strongly encouraged (though not required) to pursue independent research in some form. Students completing these requirement can be designated Certified A.C.S. Majors.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (BIMO)
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement under the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program (BIMO) in the
Courses of Instruction. Students interested in completing the BIMO program are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 321,
322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.

BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS (BiGP)
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of
Instruction. Students interested in these areas are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319, 321, 322, 324 and 367 in
addition to the first and second year required courses.

MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science program offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult
that listing.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to
report on the nature of the work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a major outlined above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study
successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a student must have at least a B- average in
all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the first semester of the senior year, the department reviews the student’s progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a
departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a
well-written thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based
on original results, combined with a strong record in all of his or her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.

EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry
Department. Registration should take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are to be taken. Students are requested to have
with them transcripts of the relevant previous college work.

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a
general nature or they may elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the divisional distribution requirement.

STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to complete a chemistry major (or chemistry requirements for pre-medical study) as well as to study abroad during their junior year are encouraged to begin taking chemistry in their first semester at Williams, and should consult with members of the department as early as possible.

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111 Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines (Not offered 2013-2014)
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied as depression
and baldness, and a cure for the common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescription. Changes in Food and Drug Administration
and health insurance policies combined with the tremendous increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a larger burden on consumers in deciding which
drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication. This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative magic as well as how
they may lead to undesired side effects. We examine the processes through which drugs are discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from
the mechanism of action of aspirin and other NSAIDs, to the chemistry and biology behind antibiotic resistance. We learn how an understanding of the body’s “natural” chemical
communication tools can inspire the design of “unnatural” molecules of therapeutic value, such as prescription antidepressants-but can also lead to drugs of abuse, like methamphetamine. The main focus of the course is fundamental concepts in medicinal chemistry and biology which underlie the action of any drug. We also explore the connections
between basic research, biotechnology companies, multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory agencies, doctors, and insurers which eventually lead to the
availability of a given drug. This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and
biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, class participation, two exams, and a final project.
Prerequisites:none; high school-level preparation in biology or chemistry is recommended. Students who have not taken any high school biology or chemistry courses should
contact the instructor before enrolling. Students who have taken CHEM 156 are not eligible.

CHEM 113(S) Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science
In this course, designed for students who do not plan to major in the natural sciences, we use a case-oriented approach to explore selected topics of forensic science. These
include: (1) the scientific and technological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of evidence, and (2) the scope of expert qualifications and
testimony, the legal status of scientific techniques, and the admissibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evidence, including glass, soil, gunpowder residues and
bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are discussed through an understanding of the basic concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry. Forensic toxicology
and pharmacology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs based upon the principles of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and
other body fluids necessitate an understanding of serology and molecular genetics. The cases which stimulate the exploration of these areas include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the Jeffrey MacDonald case (Fatal Vision), the Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn Monroe, John Belushi, and Janis Joplin, the authenticity
of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg baby kidnapping, the Tylenol poisonings, and the identity of Anastasia.
An interactive laboratory program provides an appreciation of scientific experimentation in general and the work of a crime lab in particular. It includes an analysis of evidence
collected at various crime scenes and provides an opportunity to learn forensic techniques such as chromatography (for ink, drug, and fire accelerant analysis), spectroscopy (for
alcohol and drug analysis), and electrophoresis (for DNA fingerprinting).
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets and/or quizzes, hour tests, a final exam, and laboratory performance.
No prerequisites. Not open to students who have taken CHEM 151, 153, 155, 156/251, or 256. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference: seniors and juniors.

CHEM 115(F) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of molecular biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The
intensity of the scientific investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other known pathogen. However, the early
optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now three decades into
the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 34 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We look at
how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system and discuss prospects for developing an effective HIV vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, a midterm, quizzes, a final exam, and a paper/discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60).

CHEM 116(S) Chemistry and Physics of Cooking
Cooking is a creative and artistic process, but it is based on fundamental chemical and physical principles. In this course, which is intended for students who do not plan to major
in the natural sciences, we explore these scientific principles and their application to the kitchen. We draw on edible examples such as chemical bonding and intermolecular
forces (salting, emulsification, and spherification), acid-base chemistry (leavening, making jam, and macaroni and cheese), kinetics and thermodynamics (cooking styles and
times), states of matter (carbonation, ices, foams, and gels), types of chemical reactions (baking bread, grilling vegetables, tenderizing meat), and energy transfer (kitchen equipment and gadgets). The kitchen is a laboratory—in the classroom, we carry out experiments to demonstrate and to test these scientific concepts. This course also considers the
science behind contemporary ideas in cooking known as “modernist cuisine” and/or “molecular gastronomy”. Bon appetit!
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based weekly quizzes and problem sets, two exams, and a paper.
Prerequisites: none, but students who have not taken high school chemistry should consult the instructor. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60). Preference given to seniors and
juniors.

CHEM 118 Macromolecules: The Chemistry of Really Big Things (Not offered 2013-2014)
As true today as it was in 1967 when “The Graduate” was released, “There’s a great future in plastics. Think about it.” Plastics are but one type of polymer, also known as
macromolecules, which are really long chains of repeating structural units. From synthetic to natural macromolecules, we encounter polymers everywhere and everyday. Where
would we be without Telfon, nylon, or the Frisbee? This course introduces the basics of polymer synthesis and discusses how structure defines function, beginning with chemical
bonding and materials properties. We will explore how polymers can be used in a variety of applications: textiles, fuel cells, food science, and tissue engineering to name a few.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets and/or quizzes, a midterm, a final exam, and a final project
No prerequisites., but high school-level preparation in chemistry is recommended. Students who have not taken high school chemistry should contact the instructor before

CHEM 255(F) Organic Chemistry: Intermediate Level—Special Laboratory Section
This course is a continuation of CHEM 156 and contains the same material as CHEM 251 except for the laboratory program described below:
The aim of this advanced laboratory section is to enrich and enhance the laboratory experiences of motivated students of recognized ability by providing a laboratory program
that more closely resembles the unpredictable nature and immediacy of true chemical research. Students synthesize, isolate, and characterize (using a range of modern physical
and spectroscopic techniques) a family of unknown materials in a series of experiments constituting an integrated, semester-long investigation. A flexible format is employed in
which the students are responsible for helping to plan the course of their laboratory work based upon discussions with the instructor about the previous week’s experimental

CHEM 256(S) Foundations of Modern Chemical Science
This course treats an array of topics in modern chemistry, emphasizing broad concepts that connect and weave through the various traditional subdisciplines of the field. We
begin at the microscopic level (atomic, molecular) with an introduction to coordination complexes (with applications in bioinorganic and geochemistry for instance.) From here
we move on to a detailed description of structure and bonding, comparing the strengths, weaknesses and appropriate application of various bonding theories to different types of
chemical complexes (small organic molecules, biomolecules, coordination complexes, and organic electronic materials for instance). We then transition to a broader, more
macroscopic perspective, covering chemical thermodynamics and kinetics. In this section we emphasize how these broader views allow us to study different aspects of chemical
reactivity of all types. Laboratory work includes experiments involving synthesis, characterization, and reactivity studies of coordination and organic complexes, spectroscopic
analyses, thermodynamics, kinetics, electrochemical, and nuclear chemistry.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, laboratory work, hour tests, and a final exam.

CHEM 324(S) Enzyme Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms
Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very high efficiency, stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of enzymatically-catalyzed reactions gives insight into the study of organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis especially. This course explores the methods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzymatic reactions. These methods are based on a firm foundation of chemical kinetics and organic reaction mechanisms. The first
portion of the course is devoted to enzyme kinetics and catalysis including discussions of transition state theory, structure-reactivity relationships, Michaelis-Menten parameters,
pH-dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the course progresses, the concepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic
processes as we discuss reaction intermediates and stereochemistry of enzymatic reactions. Our discussions of modern methods include the use of altered reactants, including
mechanism-based inactivators and genetically modified enzymes as tools for probing enzymatic reactions.

CHEM 341(F) Toxicology and Cancer (Same as ENVI 341)
What is a poison and what makes it poisonous? Paracelcus commented in 1537: “What is not a poison? All things are poisons (and nothing is without poison). The dose alone
keeps a thing from being a poison.” Is the picture really this bleak; is modern technology-based society truly swimming in a sea of toxic materials? How are the nature and
severity of toxicity established, measured and expressed? Do all toxic materials exert their effect in the same manner, or can materials be poisonous in a variety of different ways?
Are the safety levels set by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic materials, such as mercury, lead, and certain pesticides? How are poisons metabolized
and how do they lead to the development of cancer? What is cancer and what does it take to cause it? What biochemical defense mechanisms exist to counteract the effects of
poisons?
This course attempts to answer these questions by surveying the fundamentals of modern chemical toxicology and the induction and progression of cancer. Topics will range
from description and quantitation of the toxic response, including risk assessment, to the basic mechanisms underlying toxicity, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and DNA repair.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on two hour tests, a class presentation and paper, participation in discussion sessions, a self-exploration of the current
toxicological literature, and a final exam.

CLASSICS (Div. I)
Chair, Professor EDAN DEKEL
Professors: CHRISTENSEN, HOPPIN**. Associate Professors: DEKEL, WILCOX*. Assistant Professor: RUBIN. Visiting Assistant Professors: BOYCHENKO,
MOODIE.
The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-Roman worlds from various perspectives, including literature, history,
archaeology, art, philosophy, and religion. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The 100-level language courses are
intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal
historical periods; Latin 302 and the 400-level language courses are seminars that explore in depth selected authors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of
them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both surveys and more specialized study of the classical world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.

MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department’s faculty to ensure a well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate
to their individual interests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on courses offered in other departments that
would complement their particular interests in Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at least two of
these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language; (2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek,
Latin, or Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other departments; 3) Participation in the Senior Colloquium.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102 and one of Classics 222, 223, or 224; (2) Three additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from
approved courses in other departments (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in Latin at any level; (4) A senior independent study is
normally required to complete the Classical Civilization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each other in such a way as to
reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman
world, and ancient philosophy; 4) Participation in the Senior Colloquium.
A number of courses from other departments are cross-listed with Classics and may be elected for the major, for instance, ArtH 213 Greek Art and Myth, Philosophy 201
Greek Philosophy, and Religion 210 Reading Jesus, Writing Gospels. Appropriate courses that are not cross-listed may also count toward the major with the approval of the Chair
of Classics. Examples of such courses, which vary from year to year, are Art History 105 Picturing God in the Middle Ages, Religion/Jewish Studies 201 The Hebrew Bible,
Religion 212 The Development of Christianity, and Political Science 231 Ancient Political Thought.
Senior Colloquium: Senior majors are required to enroll in CLAS 499 in both semesters. The topics and activities of this colloquium, which normally meets every other week
for an hour, vary according to the interests of the participants. Junior majors are also encouraged to participate.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally prepare a thesis or pursue appropriate independent study in one semester and winter study of their
senior year. The thesis or independent study offers students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop the techniques and critical

99

methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a
thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that
earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not
including the thesis or independent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both through course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.

COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 300 level reflects the prerequisites involved. The only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin
302, or equivalent language preparation. The rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the important periods and
genres of classical studies. Students may enter the rotation at any point.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies.
Most of these courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.

STUDY ABROAD
We strongly encourage Classics majors to study abroad in their junior year, at programs in Italy (especially the semester-length program at the Intercollegiate Center for
Classical Studies in Rome), at programs in Greece (especially the College Year in Athens, which students need only attend for one semester), and in the Williams at Oxford
Program. Our majors have also had excellent Classics experiences in other study-abroad programs in Italy and Greece and at various universities in Europe and the United
Kingdom. In addition, we encourage students to take advantage of opportunities available in the summer: study abroad programs in Italy and Greece, archaeological digs, or even
carefully planned individual travel to sites in Greece, Italy or other areas of the ancient Greco-Roman world. When the college cannot do so, the department may be able to
provide some financial support for summer study abroad. The department’s faculty are always available to advise students, the chair has materials to share, and students can visit
the department’s website for information and links to helpful sites.

CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(S) The Trojan War (Same as COMP 107) (W)
The Trojan War may or may not have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age (c1100), but it certainly provided poets, visual artists, historians, philosophers, and many others
in archaic and classical Greece (750-320) with a rich discourse for engaging questions about gender, exchange, desire, loss, and remembrance, and about friendship, marriage,
family, army, city-state and religious cult. This discourse of “The Trojan War” attained a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the
300-400 years of Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman,
Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse.
More than half of the course will be devoted to the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; we will also read brief selections from lyric poetry (e.g. Archilochus, Sappho of Lesbos), some
selections from the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, and several tragedies (e.g. Aeschylus’ Oresteia, Sophocles’ Ajax, Euripides’ Trojan Women). We may briefly consider
a few short selections from other ancient Greek and Roman authors and/or one or two modern poets. We will also watch several films, e.g. Troy, Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?,
Gods and Monsters, Fight Club, In the Bedroom, Grand Illusion.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers involving close textual analysis, several short response papers, two 5-page papers, and
contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 35). Preference given to majors in Classics and Comparative Literature, with attention also given to assuring a balance of class
years and majors.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR

CLAS 102 Roman Literature: Foundations and Empire (Same as COMP 108) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In the first book of Vergil’s Aeneid, the god Jupiter prophesies the foundation and the greatness of Rome: “I place no limits on their fortunes and no time; I grant them empire
without end.” Yet elsewhere in this epic account of Rome’s origins, this promise of unlimited power for the descendants of Romulus seems to be seriously abridged. Some
readers have seen, not only in the Aeneid but throughout classical Roman literature, a persistent tendency to inscribe the decay and disintegration of Roman power into the very
works that proclaim and celebrate Roman preeminence. This course explores the ancient Romans’ own interpretations of their past, their present, and their destiny: the humble
beginnings of their city, its rise to supreme world power, and premonitions of its decline. Related topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the
location and expression of virtue in public and private spheres, the connections and conflicts between moral probity and political success, the exercise of individual power versus
action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign customs and peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of
empire. We will read selections and complete works by a wide variety of Roman authors, including Cicero, Catullus, Caesar, Vergil, Sallust, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and Tacitus.
All readings will be in translation.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on short written assignments, midterm and final exams with essays, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference will be given to first-year students and sophomores and to majors in Classics and Comparative Literature.

and historical context. We will draw on the rich evidence provided by literary and documentary texts, and also take into account archaeological evidence, including works of art
such as sculpture and vase painting. We will pay special attention to ritual in civic and political life, and its role in expressing and forming individual and group identity. We will
also examine the intersection of religion and literature by reading works that describe or depict cultic practice, or that were composed for performance in ritual contexts. Readings
include Homer’s Iliad, Hesiod’s Theogony, Euripides’ Bacchae, Aristophanes’ Women at the Thesmophoria, and selections from the Homeric Hymns and Pindar’s Odes.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, a midterm, a final research paper, and class participation.

CLAS 220(F) Monsters on the Margins in Ancient Greek and Roman Literature (Same as COMP 220)
What kinds of behavior qualify as monstrous? What “work” do monsters perform for a society? This course considers the intrusion of the abnormal, inappropriate, and extraordinary into Greek and Roman literature. We will trace the changing definitions of hero, monster, and outsider across time, space, and cultural context, from Odysseus and the
Cyclops to Lucius, a man transformed into an ass, and Lucian, who with his comrades fought in literature’s first interplanetary war. We will also investigate the intersection of the
“monstrous”with issues of gender, language/culture, social status, and geography. Readings will examine monsters, and outsiders depicted as monstrous, from epic (Hesiod’s
Theogony, Homer’s Odyssey, Vergil’s Aeneid, Ovid’s Metamorphoses), drama (Euripides’ Heracles, Medea, and Cyclops), philosophy (Plato’s Symposium), and novels (Apuleius’ Golden Ass, Lucian’s True History).

CLAS 224(F) (formerly 235) Roman Archaeology and Material Culture (Same as ANTH 235, ArtH 235 and HIST 224)
This course examines the development of Roman archaeology and material culture from the early Iron Age, ca. 1000 BCE, to the end of the reign of Constantine in 337 CE. The
primary goal of the course is to help students understand the social and historical context in which Roman material culture was created and used. We will consider a variety of
evidence from across the empire, including monumental and domestic architecture, wall painting, mosaics, sculpture, coins and inscriptions. Special emphasis will be placed on
the city of Rome; however, we will also look at other important urban centers, such as Pompeii, Aphrodisias and Lepcis Magna. Roman art and architecture were not the product
of any single people or culture, but rather the hybrid synthesis of complex cultural negotiations between the Romans and their colonial subjects (i.e., Greeks, Jews, Celts, etc.).
Class discussions will focus on issues related to gender, ethnicity and cultural identity in the Roman Empire. For example, we will explore what it meant to be “Roman” in terms
of language, ethnicity and cultural institutions. We will also discuss how Roman elites used material culture to convey political messages and social status in the imperial hierarchy, as well as the legacy of Roman art and architecture in the modern world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

CLAS 226T (formerly 105) The Ancient Novel (Same as COMP 226T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this course we read and closely analyze long works of fiction composed in the ancient Mediterranean between the first century BCE and the fourth century CE. To call these
ancient works “novels” might be misleading, if our definition depended on the historical conditions that fostered the emergence of the modern novel (e.g., industrialization and
widespread literacy). On another definition, however, the novel is that genre which, more than any other, devours and incorporates other genres. Judged by this standard, the
works we will deal with in this course are quintessentially novels. They afford new perspectives on the diverse, cosmopolitan culture of the Hellenistic and late antique Mediterranean world in which they were originally written and read. Replete with spectacular tales of true love, death, danger, miracles, stunts, conversions, triumphant recognitions and
happily-ever-after reconciliations, they access other classical genres such as history, tragedy, and epic by means of parody, allusion, and homage.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: alternating papers and critiques.

CLAS 230(S) Making Fun at Rome: The Origins and Influence of Satire (Same as COMP 230)
Roman satire has exerted an influence on later literature that is entirely disproportionate to its brief life as a genre and its small number of practitioners. What was the secret to
satire’s success? As we attempt to answer that question we will examine issues of genre, gender, reception and innovation, satirical personas and the abject stance, inclusion and
exclusion, sublimated violence, subversion and containment, theories of humor and laughter, and the Bakhtinian grotesque. We will consider the development of this most
capacious and omnivorous genre from its precursors in the Greek comic poets and iambic lampooners through its heyday in the late Republic and early empire. We will then turn
to considering how its very capaciousness allowed satire to rise above its generic constraints and flourish as a mode within other genres. Readings will include works by Aristophanes and from the Greek iambic tradition of invective; the Roman satire of Lucilius, Horace, Perseus, and Juvenal; and short selections from some of the most famous English–
language successors of the Roman satirists, including Chaucer, Swift, Pope, More, Johnson, Byron, Butler, Twain, Mencken, Lehrer, and Stewart and Colbert.

CLAS 239 The Construction of Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome (Same as HIST 322 and WGSS 239) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The inferior political status and heavily circumscribed lives of women in ancient Greek and Roman societies have received extensive study in recent decades. Yet it is nearly
impossible to understand women’s lives without also studying the often stringent cultural norms that governed men’s lives as well. This course seeks to understand these aspects
of Greek and Roman societies over time as expectations for the behaviors, priorities, and activities of both women and men evolved. While the impact of these gendered expectations on the lives of men and women often varied considerably in kind and degree, their interplay was at the same time often intricate, and many that constructed women’s lives
could only be articulated with reference to corresponding expectations for men. Others emerged only during times of crisis and could even involve a reversal of the usual roles of
men and women. Some norms gave men and women a shared experience that is rare in other societies.
We will explore these and related issues by reading widely in such ancient authors as Homer, Sappho, Herodotus, the Greek tragedians, Greek and Roman philosophers, Vergil
and other Latin poets, and Roman didactic writers. We will also read modern scholarship on such subjects as the family, prostitution, the exposure of unwanted infants, demography, and the anthropology of gender in both Greek and Roman societies.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, two short 5- to 7-page papers, a midterm, and a final exam.

CLAS 258 Divine Kingship in the Ancient Mediterranean (Same as ANTH 258, HIST 394 and REL 213) (Not offered 2013-2014)
What is the relationship between politics and religion? How do kings legitimate their rule? Why did the ancient Greeks and Romans worship their emperors as gods? This course
examines the origins and development of divine kingship in the ancient Mediterranean from its earliest beginnings in Pharonic Egypt to the reign of the Christian Roman Emperors in the fourth century CE. We will address the various symbolic strategies employed by ancient kings to project their own divinity. These include portraiture, panegyric poetry,
ritual processions, royal autobiography and monumental architecture, e.g., the Great Pyramids in Egypt and the Pantheon in Rome. We will also study the reception of royal art
and ideology among the king’s subjects. Special attention will be paid to the role of the Roman emperor-cult in shaping social, political and religious identity in the Roman
Empire.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm and a final exam.

CLAS 262 Performing Greece and Rome (Same as COMP 270 and THEA 262) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course explores the fluidity of genres by focusing on tragedy and comedy. Each began as a grafted thing, a hybrid, a fusion of poetic, musical and dance genres previously
developed for a variety of occasions outside the Theater of Dionysus. Fusion continued to energize both genres, and we will attend to its effects as we read several tragedies by
Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and comedies by Aristophanes from fifth-century Athens; a comedy by Menander from the early post-Alexandrian Greek world; comedies
by Plautus and Terence from republican Rome; and a tragedy by Seneca from the imperial Rome of Nero. We will also read short selections from (or read about) the genres out of
which tragedy and comedy were created and re-created, and into which they sometimes made their own incursions (e.g., heroic epic, women’s laments, choral and solo lyric
poetry, wisdom poetry, oratory, philosophical texts, histories, mime, farce, various kinds of dance, music and visual arts). We will especially attend to the ways tragedy and
comedy inflected one another. Critical readings, along with modern productions of ancient tragedies and comedies, will guide us as we consider all these generic exchanges in
light of changing conditions and occasions of theatrical performance, other public spectacles shaping the expectations of theater audiences, and the development of writing and
reading as modes of performance.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation in class, several very short essays, and two longer essays, one of which may be replaced by an original script, design
project, musical composition, or live performance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). If oversubscribed, preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, Theatre, Comparative Literature, English

CLAS 293(F) Reading Josephus: Jewish, Graeco-Roman and Christian Perspectives (Same as JWST 293, HIST 325 and REL 292)
This course offers a historical and literary approach to the varied works of the controversial Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus. Josephus was a personality intensely engaged in
the events of his day. Born into a high priestly family, he participated unwillingly in the disastrous Jewish revolt of 66-73 CE against Rome, which resulted in the destruction of
the Temple and city of Jerusalem. Having found refuge with the Roman commander, the future emperor Vespasian, Josephus went to live in Rome, concerned himself with the
political and religious position of the Jews in a difficult time, and wrote histories in Greek, including his famous eyewitness account of the ‘Jewish War’. Josephus has probably
been the most widely read historian in European Christian culture, both because he appears to provide near-contemporary testimony to Jesus Christ and because he documents
the catastrophic demise of Jewish Jerusalem. He is crucial to our understanding of the first century CE in Judaea and Galilee, as well as in the Roman empire generally. Through a
close reading of key passages, along with a selection of secondary readings that employ new approaches to historiography, new documentary material (especially the Dead Sea
Scrolls), and some remarkable archaeological finds, we will re-examine where Josephus stands, how he has been received, and where we might stand in relation to his writings.

CLAS 320T Enchantment and the Origins of Poetry (Same as COMP 320T and CLGR 410T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Since the earliest period of Greek literature, poems have been intimately bound up in the notion of enchantment, or thelxis. The power of song to alter the mental and physical
states of the audience and the world at large is intertwined with the wide variety of uses to which ancient magic was applied. Similarly, the idea of divine or supernatural inspiration can be interpreted as a reflexive enchantment that binds the poet to the transformative power of language. This tutorial course will explore the fundamental ways in which
ancient Greek and Roman poetry, and its later offspring, are configured and understood as a kind of enchantment or incantation. By examining works that explicitly depict acts of
enchantment as well as those that represent themselves as spells, dreams, charms, and curses, we will attempt to understand the structural and semantic relationships between
song and magic across several genres. We will also consider the role of inspiration, enthusiasm, memory, truth, and falsehood in shaping both the poems themselves and discourses about poetry. Finally, we will investigate the reception and elaboration of these concepts in later European poetic traditions from the middle ages through modernity.
Readings may include selections from Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, Plato’s Ion and Phaedrus, Theocritus, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Roman love elegy, Old
English charms, Old Norse poetry, Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, Shakespeare’s A Winter’s Tale, Coleridge, Shelley, Mallarmé, Valéry, T.S. Eliot, and various other poets and critics. All
works will be read in English translation, but students who have studied ancient Greek will be expected to read significant portions of the early material in the original.

CLAS 340(S) (formerly 240) Roman Cities in the Near East (Same as ANTH 240 and HIST 340) (D)
The Near East under Roman rule was a zone of intense cultural contact and exchange. Major urban centers like Ephesus and Alexandria were home to a diverse array of Greeks,
Romans, Jews, Egyptians and other Semitic peoples. Out of this cultural crucible emerged new movements in religion, science, and the arts which changed the face of the Roman
Empire. This course examines the history and material culture of Roman cities in the Near East, from Pompey’s annexation of Syria in 64 BCE to the Arab conquest in the 7th
century CE. We will consider a variety of evidence, including sculpture, architecture and epigraphy, as well as textual sources, such as Josephus’ Jewish War, Acts of the Apostles
and Tacitus’ Histories. Class discussion will focus on issues related to ethnicity and identity formation in the eastern Roman provinces. Possible topics include the Romanization
of the Near East, the First Jewish Revolt, the formation of early Christianity, and the Roman wars with Sassanian Persia. This course fulfills the EDI requirement because it
explores the interaction between peoples and cultures in the ancient Near East and their diverse responses to Roman imperialism.

CLAS 341 (formerly 238) Envisioning Empire: Geography in the Graeco-Roman World (Same as ArtH 239 and HIST 341) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
During the first century BCE, successive civil wars divided the Roman Empire along ethnic, geographical and partisan lines. Octavian’s victory at battle of Actium in 31 BCE
officially brought an end to the Roman civil wars, but it did not in itself unify the empire. Out of this matrix of social fragmentation and uncertainty arose the geographical texts of
the Augustan age. The genre of universal geography provided a convenient means to reconfigure identity boundaries in post-Actium world. By delineating stable borders between the peoples and provinces, geographical texts (whether written, sculptural or pictorial) literally mapped out identity boundaries and power relationships to create a new,
unified image of the Roman Empire. This course examines the political and cosmological of implications geographical sources produced under the Roman Empire, including the
Res Gestae of Augustus, Strabo’s Geography and Tacitus’ Germania. We will also look at maps and other visual representations of the Roman world, such as the personification
groups depicted on the Roman imperial cult temples at Aphrodisias and Pisidian Antioch. Discussion will focus on such issues as the relationship between geography and
ethnography and the differences between modern cartography and the geographical mapping techniques used in the ancient world.

CLGR 403 Poetry and Revolution in Archaic Greece (Not offered 2013-2014)
The age of experiment, lyric poetry, tyranny, migration and discovery, and the personal voice: it takes many images to describe the profound changes in Greek society, thought,
and self-expression that took place during the archaic era (roughly 800 BCE to the Persian invasion of 479 BCE). We will first read selections from the lyric poets (e.g. Archilochus and Sappho, Tyrtaeus and Solon), whose concise and expressive poems reflected contemporary culture in a way that the archaic epics did not. Their poems create for
modern readers, as they did for the Greeks, a powerful sense of the poet’s personal presence and engagement with his (or her) audience. A similar intimacy characterizes the
writings of many of the pre-Socratics, from which we will next read selections. Confident in the ability of the human mind to understand both the human and the physical world,
the pre-Socratics anticipated what came to be known as philosophy and natural science. We will then turn to other writers who spoke directly about the political upheavals of the
archaic age, focussing on the “tyrant narratives” of Herodotus. Throughout the semester we will also consider such significant material changes in the archaic era as the development of monumental public sculpture, the evolution of the temple, and the undertaking of vast building programs, all of which transformed the visual scale of the Greek cities and
their citizens’ sense of self and community.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on daily translations and contributions to class discussion, several translation quizzes, an oral presentation, a final paper,

CLGR 404 Tragedy (Not offered 2013-2014)
Tragedy was a hybrid genre invented in sixth-fifth century Athens, where tragic performances in the city’s festival of the Greater Dionysia played a vital role in the democratic
polis. This course will focus on reading in Greek a complete tragedy of Sophokles or Euripides; we will also read in translation several other tragedies, a satyr-play, and a comedy
of Aristophanes. While focusing on questions of particular importance for the play we are reading in Greek, we will also situate that play in a larger context by exploring, for
instance: aspects of the social and political situations in and for which fifth-century tragedies were first produced; the several performance genres out of which tragedy was
created; developments in the physical characteristics of the theater and in elements of staging and performance; problems of representation particularly relevant to theatrical
production and performance.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, several 1- to 2-page papers involving close textual analysis, perhaps a midterm exam, a final

through such poets as Solon, Anacreon, Ibycus, and Theognis, we will examine the formal, social, and performative contexts of lyric, the influence of epic and choral poetry on
the evolution of the genre, and the difficulties of evaluating a fragmentary corpus. Finally, we will explore the influence of political and economic changes in the early fifth
century on the work of Simonides. The goal throughout is to investigate the structures, innovations, and problems of poetic self-expression in early Greek poetry.

CLGR 406T Coming of Age in the Polis (Same as WGSS 406T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Studying a society’s modes of rearing its young, and especially the ways it prepares and tests adolescents for their “coming of age” into their adult roles, provides an excellent
approach to exploring its fundamental values and institutional practices. Archaic and classical Greek literature not only reflects but actively reflects upon the socialization of boys
and girls in the Greek polis. In this course we will read in Greek selections from the Homeric Hymns to Demeter and Apollo and, in its entirety, a tragedy (e.g., Sophocles’
Philoctetes), examining these texts through the lens of “coming of age.” We will read in English brief selections from Homeric epic and from elegiac and lyric poetry (monodic
and choral), and several Athenian tragedies and perhaps a comedy. We will also read critical literature on childrearing, religious cults for boys and girls of different ages, and the
role of dance, song and poetry in preparing the young for their adult roles, particularly in fifth-century Athens.
Students will be divided into tutorial pairs chiefly according to their previous experience in Greek courses. Students will meet with the instructor once a week either individually
or in pairs to present their translations of the Greek assigned for that week, and they will also meet once a week in pairs for the oral presentation of written 5-page reports. At the
latter meeting, each student will alternate between making a formal presentation one week and, in the next week, offering an oral critique of the other student’s presentation.

CLGR 407 Rhetoric and Democracy: the Greek Orators (Not offered 2013-2014)
The Greek orators of the 4th-century BCE have left us a rich and varied body of work. They were specialists in rhetoric and persuasive discourse, and in the deployment of the
one to produce the other. They wrote forensic oratory intended to sway juries, often with little reference to the facts of the case; political speeches with which they argued policy
before the Athenian Assembly and aspired to be the city’s leaders; attack speeches which they hoped would destroy their rivals; and show pieces intended to dazzle the listener
with their rhetorical brilliance. Political careers were launched not by the noble birth and military success that were so important in the previous century, but by high-profile
prosecutions won by oratorical prowess. In their own words, the most influential orators of 4th-century Athens will instruct us in rhetoric, demonstrate the stylistic versatility of
the Greek language, teach us about what Athenians in the 4th century cared about, reveal theories of human psychology, and persuade us of a thing or two. We will read selected
speeches by Lysias, Aeschines, and Demosthenes, as well as portions of speeches by other orators such as Isocrates, Antiphon, and Dinarchus.

Plato’s writing has exercised an incalculable influence on the development of subsequent philosophy and literature, but his dialogues are equally compelling when they are read
independently of the works they have inspired. In this course we will read substantial selections from one or more of the so-called middle dialogues (Symposium, Phaedo,
Republic, Phaedrus), in which a variety of speakers, including Socrates, ask and provisionally answer questions such as what are love, beauty, and justice, and how does the
human soul in possession of these goods participate in the divine?

intellectual landscape reflect the influence of Greek and near-eastern oral traditions, Ionian philosophical thought, Greek tragedy, and contemporary Athenian rhetoric and philosophy. We will also study his use of anthropological methods, ethnography, and geography in explaining human events. Among the many themes that permeate his work, we will
pay special attention to the working of divine versus human justice, the mutability of human affairs, the nature of authority, the role of family, and the quest for wisdom.

CLGR 413(F) Hellenistic Poetry
After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, a new cultural center emerged in the recently founded city of Alexandria in Egypt. From across the Greek–speaking world,
intellectuals who were both scholars and poets flocked to Alexandria’s Museion (the shrine to the Muses) and its renowned library to categorize and organize the literature of the
past while creating new kinds of poetry and poetic ideals. This course surveys the poetry of Hellenistic period with a focus on the “big three” poets of the third century, Callimachus, Theocritus, and Apollonius of Rhodes, who were especially influential on later Latin poetry of the Republic and Augustan ages. As we read a variety of texts including

103

epigrams, hymns, mimes, pastoral idylls, and selections from epic, we will pay close attention to issues of genre, the tension between tradition and innovation, and the cultural
context of Greco–Egyptian Alexandria.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, shorter written exercises and/or oral reports, midterm and final exams, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: CLGR 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected 5–7). Preference given to Classics majors.

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester
is devoted to reading selections from Latin poetry (e.g., Vergil’s Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina Burana) and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny’s Letters
and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed for the student with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a refresher. Credit is granted
for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult the department.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exercises, and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 8-10).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF
11:00-12:15 MWF

First Semester: MOODIE
Second Semester: RUBIN

CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin: The Late Republic
Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and from the poetry of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of
Latin grammar and aims primarily at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the most turbulent and important periods in Roman
history and attends to the development of their interpretative and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be
required as well.
Prerequisites: CLLA 101-102 or 3-4 years of Latin in secondary school: consult the department. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF

RUBIN

CLLA 302(S) Vergil’s Aeneid
This course is a comprehensive introduction to Vergil’s Aeneid. Students will develop their ability to read and translate the Latin text of the poem, while at the same time exploring the major interpretive issues surrounding the definitive Roman epic. Through a combination of close reading and large-scale analysis, we will investigate the poem’s literary,
social, and political dimensions with special attention to Vergil’s consummate poetic craftsmanship.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10).

CLLA 401 Plautus’ Rome Made Visible (Not offered 2013-2014)
Augustus famously claimed to have found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble, but Rome had been a visually impressive city since the sixth century. Romans in every
period and of every status experienced their lives with an intense sense of time and place in this gloriously multi-class, multi-ethnic, and multi-lingual city, filled with public
spectacles that often competed with one another to map Rome and its history. We will explore Rome of the Middle Republic through selected fragments of Livius Andronicus,
Naevius, Ennius, and the elder Cato, as well as some remains of much older Latin, but our chief guide will be Plautus’ comedy, the Aulularia (circa 190). This play was produced
after more than a century of temple-building, monument-erecting, cult-and-festival-creating, and story-promoting that would shape every subsequent version of Rome, in real
space and time and in the imaginary. The Aulularia takes us into the heart of this loud, crowded and busy Rome—even though it purports to be set in Athens. In using this play as
our guide to Rome, we will examine Romans’ self-fashioning through a creative appropriation of “the other” which insists on maintaining a distance from that other, be it Greek
or Sabine, female or eunuch, slave or plebeian.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, several short essays or oral presentations, a longer final paper, and midterm and final exams.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-7). Preference will be given to majors and prospective majors in Classics and Comparative Literature.
HOPPIN
CLLA 403 The Invention of Love: Catullus and the Roman Elegists (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will explore the development of Latin love poetry in the first century BCE. Beginning with Catullus, we will examine the influence of Greek lyric poetry on the
evolution of the genre as well as Roman attitudes toward love exhibited in other literature of the Late Republic. We will then turn to the full development of the elegiac form in the
love poems of Propertius, Tibullus, and Sulpicia. Finally, we will explore the transformation of the genre in Ovid’s Amores. The goal throughout is to investigate the conventions,
innovations, and problems of expressing personal desire and longing amid the social and political upheaval of the transition from Republic to Principate.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10-12). Preference given to Classics majors.
DEKEL

CLLA 405 Livy and Tacitus: Myth, Scandal, and Morality in Ancient Rome (Not offered 2013-2014)
Mythical stories of Rome’s founding, which were formulated by many generations of Roman authors and public figures, served as a framework for these very thinkers to analyze
and articulate Roman self-image in rich and creative ways; one who stands out among these figures is the Augustan historian Livy. The “second founding” of the Republic by
Augustus, and the careers of his successors, in turn gave later Roman writers like Tacitus fresh inspiration for Roman self-imagining and self-analysis.
We will begin the semester in mythical Rome, reading selections from Book 1 of Livy’s history which present figures like Aeneas, the Trojan refugee whose arrival in Italy was
conceptually crucial to Rome’s development and position in Italy and the Mediterranean; Romulus, by whom Rome was founded in an act of fratricide; the Sabine women,
whose nobility prevented a deadly war between their fathers and their Roman kidnappers; and Lucretia, whose virtue and self-sacrifice led to the liberation of Rome from a
decadent and violent monarchy and to the founding of the Roman Republic. We will examine how Livy deploys the storyteller’s art to excite his readers’ pathos, indignation, and
sympathy; we will examine as well how Livy often filters his account of mythical Rome through the lens of his own time, thereby constructing Rome’s past through the Augustan
present.
Writing more than a century after Livy, Tacitus offers a different view of Augustus, and his account of the rude and dissolute Tiberius, the unscrupulous Livia, Rome’s craven and
dispirited senators, and the many scandals attached to the imperial family, figures a Rome once again suffering under a decadent monarchy. Tacitus’s compressed, fastidious,
inimitable prose is the vehicle for his stern yet often sardonic psychological insights, which subtly manage to combine moral judgment with prurient pleasure in the scandals of
others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, an 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6).
CHRISTENSEN

CLLA 406 Horace Odes 1-3 (Not offered 2013-2014)
Nietzsche claimed that he never had an artistic delight comparable to his experience of reading a Horatian ode. Through close readings of selected odes in Books 1-3 we will seek
to experience such delight for ourselves and to learn why, as Nietzsche put it, “what is here achieved is in certain languages not even to be hoped for.” We will examine the
relation between poetic landscapes, poetic programs and the poetry’s exploration of subjects like love, friendship, youth and old age, death, politics, private morality; the poet’s
capacity to define himself by offering his own account of poetic traditions and his place in them; the variety of voices and perspectives within individual poems and throughout
the collection; the demands thereby placed on the poet’s audience and the power of the poetry to transform an audience equal to those demands. It is in terms of this transformational power of poetry that we will consider Horace’s relationship to his contemporaries, particularly Vergil, his patron Maecenas, and Augustus.
Evaluation will be based on contributions in the classroom, two 2- to 3-page papers (translation with comments), a short memorization assignment, perhaps a midterm, a final
paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of instructor.
HOPPIN

CLLA 407 Caesar and Cicero (Not offered 2013-2014)
The one a brilliant strategist, the other preeminent in the courts, Caesar and Cicero were both master politicians whose ambitions for themselves and for their country brought
them into bitter conflict. Their combined oeuvres provide compelling, detailed accounts of the events and personalities that ended the Roman republic and ushered in an era of
prolonged civil war. Moreover, despite striking differences, their works can justifiably be claimed to be the twin summits of classical Latin prose. In this course we will read
extensive selections from Caesar’s commentarii (the Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile) and from Cicero’s speeches and letters, aiming throughout at a better understanding of
these authors’ stylistic achievements as well as the pragmatic persuasive goals that drove their rhetoric.

104

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short written assignments (such as article reviews), a midterm exam and essay of moderate
length, plus a final exam and longer paper.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:12 (expected: 6-9).
WILCOX
CLLA 408(S) Roman Comedy
About fifteen years after the Romans’ hard–fought victory over Hannibal and the Carthaginians in the devastating Second Punic War, Plautus presented to his Roman audience a
new comedy, Poenulus (The Little Carthaginian). Surprisingly, Plautus’ little Carthaginian seems to be the hero of the play. This course will engage the vexed questions surrounding the interpretation of this play and its many Carthaginian characters through a variety of approaches. We will consider how genre, the play’s political, social, and
religious contexts, and especially different aspects of performance might influence our understanding of the play. While focusing on the Poenulus, we will explore the textual and
archaeological evidence for ancient dramatic performance, and we will read other plays by Plautus. Finally, we will consider the influence of Roman comedy on later comedic
traditions, from commedia dell’arte to the modern musical and the sitcom.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation (including a brief dramatic performance), an article review, one paper of 8-10 pages, a midterm and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-10). Preference will be given to majors and potential majors in Classics and Comparative Literature.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF
MOODIE
CLLA 409 Seneca and the Self (Not offered 2013-2014)
Through a close reading of selections from his Dialogues, Epistulae Morales, and a tragedy (probably Medea), this course will consider ethical and literary dimensions of
self-fashioning, self-examination, and the conception of self in the Stoic philosophy of the younger Seneca. The focus of this course lies squarely in the first century CE, and on
the analysis of Seneca’s own texts. We will begin, however, with an introduction to the ethics of Roman Stoicism through the personae theory of Panaetius as recorded in Cicero’s
De Officiis. Moreover, we will read and discuss selections from some of Seneca’s most famous and influential interpreters, including Montaigne and Foucault, in order to enrich
our understanding of contemporary assessments of his work and to gain an appreciation of Seneca’s considerable influence on later theorizations of selfhood.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short written and oral assignments, midterm and final exams, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).
WILCOX
CLLA 412 Roman Ethnography (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course explores the development of Roman ethnography from the Late Republic into the early Empire. We will begin by examining how Greek ethnographic accounts of
the barbarian ”Other” influenced Roman writers of the late Republic, and then move on to assess the impact of Roman imperial ideology on the further development of the genre.
Roman ethnographers appealed to popular tropes and ethnic stereotypes that were easily intelligible to their Roman audience. As a result, their writings tell us far less about the
foreign peoples and places they claim to describe than about the cultural and political aspirations of the Romans themselves. In addition to reading excerpts, in Latin, from
Caesar’s De Bello Gallico, Ovid’s Tristia, and Tacitus’ Agricola, we also will read selections from Catullus, Pliny’s Natural History, and the earliest Roman geographer, Pomponius Mela.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, a midterm exam, an 8- to 10-page final paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-9). Preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, History, Art History.
RUBIN
CLLA 414(F) Vergil’s Eclogues and Georgics
This course will explore the two major works of Vergil that precede the Aeneid: the Eclogues, a series of ten pastoral poems that range widely across personal, political, and
mythological themes; and the Georgics, a longer didactic poem in four books that uses an agricultural framework to examine issues of life, death, power, suffering, and love. The
goal throughout is to investigate the literary, political, and social dimensions of the poems with special attention to their relationship to earlier models, as well as their exquisite
poetic craftsmanship.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam
Prerequisites: CLLA 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to Classics majors.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JOSEPH CRUZ
Advisory Committee: Professors: DANYLUK, KIRBY, H. WILLIAMS***, ZAKI. Associate Professor: CRUZ. Assistant Professor: KORNELL.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, represent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it
combines research and theory from computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive researchers in any discipline
typically employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science are
broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad
interdisciplinary foundation needed to approach issues of cognition.

THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four electives, and a senior seminar.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry point into the concentration, and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it
should be taken before the end of the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be distributed over at least three course
prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will participate in a senior seminar (COGS 493).

REQUIRED COURSES
COGS/PHIL/PSYC 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
COGS 493 Senior Seminar

ELECTIVES
Four electives are required, chosen from at least three prefixes, at most two of which can be at the 100 level.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program
will consist of COGS W31-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be
interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.

STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to discuss plans for study abroad are invited to meet with any member of the Cognitive Science advisory committee.
COGS 222(F) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science (Same as PHIL 222 and PSYC 222)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive
psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical foundations of cognitive science,
representation and computation in symbolic and connectionist architectures, concept acquisition, problem solving, perception, language, semantics, reasoning, and artificial
intelligence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, and self-paced weekly exercises.
Prerequisites: PSYC 101 or any introduction to Philosophy course or CSCI 134 or permission of instructor. Background in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment
limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-and second-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

COGS 493(F) Senior Seminar
The goal of the cognitive science senior seminar is threefold. Firstly, we will revisit the foundations of cognitive research by reading some of the classics that established cognitive
science as a field in the middle of the 20th century. Secondly, we will engage current research trends in cognitive studies by looking at work published in the last five years on
cognitive neuroscience, embodied cognition, dynamic systems theory, empirical approaches to consciousness, and situated robotics. In addition to attending to the specific
empirical details of this latter work, we will also discuss how current research elaborates, expands, and sharpens early conceptions of the domain and methodology of cognitive
science. Our final goal will be the preparation of individual research papers by members of the class. These will be on topics determined in collaboration with the instructor.
Students will be responsible for presentations on the assigned readings, and for the development of a final paper involving independent research.
Format: seminar or tutorial, depending on enrollment. Requirements: several short assignments, final paper, attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: required of, and open only to, senior cognitive science concentrators (though in unusual circumstances non-concentrators may take the class with permission of the
cognitive science advisory committee). Enrollment limit: number of senior concentrators.
Hour: TBA

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Associate Professor CHRISTOPHER BOLTON
Professors: BELL-VILLADA, CASSIDAY, DRUXES, B. KIEFFER*, NEWMAN, ROUHI. Associate Professors: C. BOLTON, DEKEL, S. FOX,
FRENCH, KAGAYA, MARTIN, NUGENT*, PIEPRZAK, THORNE, VAN DE STADT, WANG. Assistant Professors: BRAGGS, HOLZAPFEL,
NAAMAN*, VARGAS. Visiting Assistant Professors: EL-ANWAR, EQEIQ.
Students motivated by a desire to study literary art in the broadest sense of the term will find an intellectual home in the Program in Comparative Literature. The Program in
Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical faculties through the analysis of literature across cultures, and through the exploration of literary
and critical theory. By crossing national, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning,
the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible
range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of media, genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investigating literature’s larger
context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study
of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams curriculum. In addition, the Program offers courses in literary theory that illuminate the study of texts of all sorts. Note: the English Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English major.
Students majoring in comparative literature choose one of two tracks. Both tracks prepare students for a range of options after graduation, by developing analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and by allowing the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily shaped by the student’s own interests.

MAJOR
Track 1
This track within the Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single foreign-language literature with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across
national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Each student on this track must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the serious study of literature in
foreign languages other than the student’s specialty is strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish.
Each student should choose a faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.

Eleven courses are required for track 1 of the major:
Comparative Literature 110 Introduction to Comparative Literature OR Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any three comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets at least one of the following criteria: a) it must be genuinely comparative across
cultures and/or b) it must primarily treat literary theory. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program in Comparative Literature or from the
offerings of other departments and programs, including, but not limited to, the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Africana Studies, Latino/Latina Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Examples of core courses include the following (please be aware that this is not an exhaustive list; consult with a
major advisor about which courses may count as cores):
COMP 117 Introduction to Cultural Theory

106

COMP 200 European Modernism—and its Discontents
COMP 205 The Book of Job and Joban Literature
COMP 223 Comparative Middle Eastern and Latin American Cultural Studies
COMP 237 Gender and Desire 1200-1600
COMP 242T Americans Abroad
COMP 243 Modern Women Writers and the City
COMP 259 Adultery in the Nineteenth-Century Novel
COMP 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis
COMP 343 Modern Critical Theory
COMP 345 Museums, Memorials, and Monuments: The Representation and Politics of Memory
COMP 380 Literary and Critical Theory in the Twentieth Century
Students should aim to complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year.
Three literature courses in the student’s specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At least one of the three must be at the 300-level or above. Students
should aim to acquire intermediate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student’s specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected
from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student’s major advisor. Only one may be in English or American literature.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)—Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
With the permission of their advisor or the chair, students may also count appropriate courses in music or art toward major requirements. Students pursuing the Comparative
Literature major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three
courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. At least one of the courses counted toward the major must be Writing Intensive.
Track 2
This track within the Comparative Literature major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Students in
this track are not required to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student should
choose a faculty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for track 2 of the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative OR Comparative Literature 110 Introduction to Comparative Literature
Any four comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets at least one of the following criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it
must be genuinely comparative across cultures and/or primarily theoretical. The four core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program in Comparative
Literature or from the offerings of other departments and programs, including , but not limited to, the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Africana Studies, Latino/Latina Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. See above under “Track 1” for some examples of core courses. (Please be aware that this is
not an exhaustive list; consult with a major advisor about which courses may count as cores.) Students should aim to complete core course requirements by the end of
their junior year.
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature
offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student’s major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Comparative Literature, no more than
two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these five.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)—Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
With the permission of their advisor or the chair, students may also count appropriate courses in music or art toward major requirements. Students who choose to study abroad
during their junior year may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. At least
one of the courses counted toward the major must be Writing Intensive.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Comparative Literature are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal. In addition, candidates must
demonstrate a strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Comparative Literature are strongly urged to secure an advisor by the end of the week after Spring Break in their junior year. By May
15th of their junior year, candidates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. The Advisory Committee will
inform candidates by June 1 whether they may proceed with the thesis and advise them about any changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the project. The summer
before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and preparing for the process of writing the thesis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses (493-W31-494). By the end of the Fall semester, students will normally
have undertaken substantial research and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. At this point students should also have a clear sense of the work remaining for
completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students will also have chosen and met with a second reader for the project, who will provide additional guidance and
read the final thesis. By the end of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire project. At that time, the Comparative Literature Advisory Committee,
together with the advisor, will determine whether the project may continue as an Honors Thesis, or whether its first portions (COMP 493-W) will be graded as Independent
Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due one week before the last day of classes.
At the end of the Spring term, the student will make a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee will be specially invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical. It is also possible to write a thesis that consists of an original translation of a significant text or texts; in this case,
a theoretical apparatus must accompany the translation. The complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, excluding the bibliography.
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (COMP 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee will determine whether a candidate will receive Honors, Highest
Honors, or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including the thesis course (COMP 493-W-494)-is 12, i.e., one of the thesis
courses may substitute for one elective.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Comparative Literature strongly urges its students to study abroad. Students in track 1 should seriously consider study abroad in a country where their specialty language is spoken; they will likely be able to complete some of the specialty language courses required for the major during study abroad. But all students can benefit from
study abroad; literature courses from abroad are often candidates for credit as major electives.

COMP 110(S) Introduction to Comparative Literature (Same as ENGL 241)
Comparative literature involves reading and analyzing literature that spans a range of different times, cultures, and media. In this class we will study English translations of texts
that belong to several important literary traditions: Japanese, Chinese, and Greek classics; 19th-century Russian, French, and German fiction; and visual texts from oil painting to
graphic novels, video games, and film. Throughout the course we will consider what it means to think about all these different works as literary texts. To help with this, we will

107

also read some representative works of literary theory that have tried to define literature in abstract or philosophical terms. Assignments will focus on close reading of relatively
short texts by authors like Homer, Sei Shônagon, Wu Cheng’en, Kleist, Tolstoy, Zola, Maupassant, Wilde, Shklovsky, Bakhtin, Borges, Mamet, and Bechdel. All readings will be
in English.
Format: lecture with discussion. Requirements/Evaluation: regular attendance, participation, four 1-page response papers, and two 5- to 7-page papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 35). Preference given to students considering a major in Comparative Literature.

COMP 200(S) European Modernism—and Its Discontents
What is/was Modernism? An artistic movement? A new dynamic and sensibility? A transformative response to changed conditions? All these and more? This course will
attempt to deal with such issues via examination of certain key works spanning the years 1850-1930. Topics to be considered: the rise of industrial capitalism and the literary
market, advances in science and technology, urban alienation and social conflict, anti-”bourgeois” stances, the displacement of religion, the fragmented self, the proliferation of
multiple perspectives, the breaks with the past and privileging of the present, and the horrors of war. To be studied: poetry by Baudelaire, Yeats, and Neruda; prose fiction by
Dostoevsky, Kafka, Proust, Joyce, and Woolf; drama by Beckett; Futurist and Surrealist manifestoes; German Expressionist films; and theoretical writings by Marx, Freud,
Nietzsche, Ortega y Gasset, and Benjamin. In addition, select portions of Bell-Villada’s Art for Art’s Sake and Literary Life and Peter Gay’s Modernism will serve as general
background to the course. All readings in English.

COMP 209(S) Dolls, Puppets and Automatons
Since their origin, humans have always made anthropomorphic representations, first in the form of idols, fetishes, or statues for religious worship, later in the shape of puppets,
dolls, or automatons for their entertainment qualities. And yet, these objects have always played multiple roles in human society; modernity in particular shows a great interest
paired with great ambivalence towards dolls, puppets, and automatons, regarded both as uncanny Doppelgänger or threatening machines. In order to comprehend the scope of
our modern fascination with these figures, we will explore their haunting presence in literary texts by ETA Hoffmann, Theodor Storm, Villiers de L’Isle Adam, Felisberto
Hernandez, discuss theoretical texts by Sigmund Freud and Heinrich von Kleist, look at paintings by Oskar Kokoschka, George Grosz and look at photographs by Hans Bellmer,
watch a ballet by Kurt Joos and films by Fritz Lang and Ridley Scott, and watch a fashion show by Alexander McQueen. Conducted in English.

COMP 212(S) Nordic Lights: Literary and Cultural Diversity in Modern Scandinavia (Same as WGSS 200) (D)
Mythologized as the land of the aurora borealis and the midnight sun, Scandinavia’s five distinct nations—Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland—are often mistakenly associated with blond-haired and blue-eyed uniformity. Modern Scandinavia, however, is a place of great social and cultural diversity. From medieval Viking sagas to
contemporary Nordic rap, the Scandinavian literary tradition is rich in tales of global exploration, childhood imagination, sexual revolution, and multicultural confrontation.
Through readings of nineteenth-century drama, twentieth-century novels, and twenty-first century cinema, we will investigate a wide range of issues on class, ethnicity, and
identity, including the indigenous reindeer-herding Sami people, Danish colonialism and the Greenlandic Inuit, Norwegian collaboration and resistance during World War II, and
Nordic emigration (to North America) and immigration (from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East). Discussion will also focus on Scandinavia’s leadership in
gender equality and sexual liberation, Scandinavian political isolation and integration (into both the UN and the EU), and the global effects of Nordic pop (ABBA to Björk),
glamour (Greta Garbo to Helena Christensen), technology (Volvo to Nokia), and design (IKEA to H&M). Readings to include works by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Hans
Christian Andersen, Karen Blixen, Astrid Lindgren, Halldór Laxness, Reidar Jönsson, and Peter Høeg. Films to include works by Ingmar Bergman, Lasse Hallström, Bille
August, Colin Nutley, Lukas Moodysson, Josef Fares, Tomas Alfredson, and Tomas Vinterberg. All readings and discussions in English.

COMP 227 Writing Translation: Language and Literature in a Global Age (Not offered 2013-2014)
As more and more people from far-flung countries come into contact with each other, the language question is thrust to the fore. The site of language contact is more often than
not a site of language clash, with governments both seeking to force a national language on immigrants while deploying foreign language speakers to conduct interventions
abroad. Literature responds to this situation in myriad ways: by thematizing language issues, by violating “standard” languages, and, not least, by translation. Approaching
Anglophone and non-English literatures from both a political and an aesthetic point of view, we will analyze authors—and translators—formal choices for what they say about
context, genre, and literature in general. Readings include texts on postcolonial and translation theory, language policies and immigration law, and novels and films by Ken
Saro-Wiwa, Tayeb Salih, R. Zamora Linmark, W.G. Sebald, Quentin Tarantino, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short writing assignments, one midterm paper, one final research paper.

COMP 231T Postmodernism (Same as ENGL 266T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W) (D)
In one definition, postmodernism in art and literature is what you get when you combine modernism’s radical experimentation with pop culture’s easy appeal. This term has been
used to describe works from Andy Warhol’s paintings of Campbell’s soup cans and Jean Baudrillard’s critical essays on Disneyland to Thomas Pynchon’s paranoid novel about
postal conspiracy, The Crying of Lot 49. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it represents not only a radical change in aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new
relationship between art, language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical essays defining the postmodern (essays which themselves
often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair them with artistic texts that are said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly
novels and short stories from various countries, but one feature of this theory is a flattening of the distinction between high and low culture as well as between the written and the
visual, so we will also examine examples from architecture, visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Along the way will ask whether global theoretical paradigms like postmodernism can help us understand other cultures better (by locating them within a single universal system), or whether this approach conceals important cultural differences. Texts will
include essays by Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Jean-François Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino,
and Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat; the architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will focus on
reading the theoretical texts critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores as well as advanced students.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After an introductory lecture meeting, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for approximately an hour each week; they will write a
5-page paper every other week (five in all), and respond to their partners’ papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be on understanding and engaging the criticism that we read,
and comparing the critical and fictional texts creatively in a way that sheds light on both.
Prerequisites: a 100-level literature course (COMP, ENGL, etc.) and sophomore standing or higher, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Priority
will be given to students majoring in a discipline related to critical theory (or considering such a major) and those with a demonstrated interest in the material.

COMP 236(F) Screens of Terror: Representations of War, Terror, and Terrorism in Western Films after 9/11 (Same as INST 239) (W) (D)
How has Hollywood contributed to “the war on terror?” What is the effect of the media on public opinion about this new kind of war? This course will seek to answer these
questions through a critical examination of recent Western films with explicit portrayals of 9/11, acts of terrorism, terrorists, Arabs, Muslims, and western military and politicians.
Using methods of literary analysis, we will examine such films as Syriana (2005), United 93 (2006), The Hurt Locker (2009), Avatar (2009), and Iron Man 3 (2013) among
others to reflect on how experiences of war, terror, and terrorism have been recently represented on screen. We will also investigate how Hollywood practices have been implemented in other world cinemas in the recent years. Among others, we will look into how the on–going Russo–Chechen conflict has been represented in Russian cinema before
and after 9/11. Readings in film interpretation will range from early film theorists such as Eisenstein and Krakauer to contemporary literary critics such as Eagleton and Jameson.
We will also review relevant cultural theory and criticism addressing questions of orientalism (Said and Shaheen) and the role of media in the construction of public opinion
(Zizek, Baudrillard, and Chomsky). This EDI course will engage with questions of ethnic, religious, and national identity in the highly polarized post 9/11 landscape and ask
students to (re)consider the tangled notions of perspective and representation. Students will also come away with techniques in film analysis, practice in writing reviews, and a
deepened understanding of the relationship between society and film today.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, frequent short writing assignments (3 pages), a final paper (3 pages), and an oral presentation.

This course will explore some of the many incarnations of American experiences abroad between the end of the 19th century and the present day. Readings will be drawn from
novels, short stories, films, and nonfiction about Americans in Europe in times of war and peace. We will compare and contrast the experiences of novelists, soldiers, students,
war correspondents, jazz musicians, and adventurers. What has drawn so many Americans to Europe? What is the difference between a tourist, an expat, and an émigré? What

109

are the profound, and often comic, gaps between the traveler’s expectations and the reality of living in, say, Paris or a rural village in Spain? What are the misadventures and
unexpected rewards of living, working, writing, or even falling in love in translation? Authors may include: Henry James, Langston Hughes, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway, Elaine Dundy, Richard Wright, and Ben Lerner.
Additional reading will be drawn from historical and critical works. All readings will be in English.
This comparative course fulfills the EDI requirement because it is designed to highlight the challenges and benefits of cultural immersion abroad. It will focus on the linguistic,
emotional, intellectual, and social adaptation skills that are required to understand others, and oneself, in new contexts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meetings between the instructor and each pair of students will take place once a week. Each student will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other
week to which their partner will formally respond during our meeting. One of these writing assignments will be a personal travel narrative based on the student’s own experiences.
Prerequisites: any literature course at Williams or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to students interested in, or returning from,

COMP 243(S) (formerly 252) Modern Women Writers and the City (Same as WGSS 252) (W)
Ambivalence has always been a vital part of literary responses to city life. Whether they praise the city or blame it, women writers react to the urban environment in a significantly
different way from men. While male writers have often emphasized alienation and strangeness, women writers have celebrated the mobility and public life of the city as liberating. We will look at issues of women’s work, class politics, sexual freedom or restriction, rituals of consumption, the conservation of memory by architecture, and communitybuilding in cities like London, New York, Berlin, Paris. We will examine novels and short stories about the modern city by writers as diverse as Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein,
Anzia Yezierska, Ann Petry, Jean Rhys, Marguerite Duras, Margaret Drabble Ntozake Shange, Verena Stefan, Jhumpa Lahiri and Edwidge Danticat. We will consider theoretical
approaches to urban spaces by feminists (Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Wilson), architectural historians (Christine Boyer) and anthropologists and sociologists (Janet Abu-Lughod, David Sibley, Michael Sorkin). Several contemporary films will be discussed. All readings in English.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: two short papers of 3-5 pages, one of 5-7 pages, and one final paper of 8-10 pages.

COMP 253(S) Narratives of Placement and “Dis-placement” from the Global South (Same as ARAB 253) (W)
This seminar deals with the theme of placement and “dis-placement” in literature from different sites in the Global South in the late 20th century. Situating the question of
placement and uprootedness within multiple historical and cultural contexts in different sites in the Southern hemisphere, the location of much of the ”developing world,” including the Middle East and North-Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the African Diaspora and the US-Mexico borderland, we will address the following questions: What
distinguishes exile from Diaspora? What constitutes ”dis-placement”? How do the experiences of up-rootedness and forced migration among Palestinian refugees and Mexican
migrant workers (within Mexico and the US; with or without documents) inform our notion of home and belonging? How do the legacy of French colonialism in North Africa
and the rise of globalization in Latin America, for example, shed light on the ongoing massive immigration of subjects from the Global South to the North? Our emphasis will be
on working together to find avenues for expressing yourselves in writing and other media, such as creating your own blog entries about these topics. In addition to a course reader
with selected stories, poems, and critical essays, readings will include: Benyamin’s Goat Days, Aimé Césaire’s Return to My Native Land, Ghassan Kanafani’s Men in the Sun,
Mamud Darwish’s Journal of an Ordinary Grief, and Laila Lalami’s Hope & Other Dangerous Pursuits.

COMP 255 Love and Death in Modern Japanese Literature (Same as JAPN 255) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
The initial thing that surprises many first-time readers of modern Japanese fiction is its striking similarity to Western fiction. But equally surprising are the intriguing differences
that lie concealed within that sameness. This course investigates Japanese culture and compares it with our own by reading Japanese fiction about two universal human experiences—love and death—and asking what inflections Japanese writers give these ideas in their work. The course begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the
eighteenth century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics to TV dramas. From there we move on to novels and
films that examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at
an advanced age. We will read novels and short stories by canonical modern authors like Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima as well as more contemporary fiction by writers like
Murakami Haruki; we will also look at some visual literature, including puppet theater, comics, animation, and Japanese New Wave film.
The class and the readings are in English. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: In-class exam, ungraded creative project, and two short papers (5-7 pages each) emphasizing original, creative, and convincing readings of the class texts.

and 1970s; and a few contemporary figures like Kitano “Beat” Takeshi. We will also consider popular genres like swordplay films, J-Horror, and anime, focusing on some
directors whose work seems to borrow equally from genre film and the artistic avant- garde. All texts are translated or subtitled in English.
Format: lecture . Requirements: regular attendance in class and at some evening screenings, weekly film viewing and readings in film theory and criticism, and several short
response assignments, plus two 5- to 6-page papers and one test.

In this tutorial, we will read four novels written between 1850 and 1900, all of which focus on the figure of the adulteress: Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary (1856), Lev
Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina (1873-77), Leopoldo Alas y Ureña’s La Regenta (1884-85), and Theodor Fontane’s Effi Briest (1894). For each week of class, students will read one of
these primary texts, as well as a selection of secondary literature that will allow us to understand, over the course of the semester, how and why the adulteress played a key role in
the cultural imagination of Europe during this time. All works will be read in English translation.

COMP 264 Beauty, Danger and the End of the World in Japanese Literature (Same as JAPN 254) (Not offered 2013-2014)
From the endemic warfare of the medieval era to the atomic bombing and the violent explosion of technology in the last century, the end of the world is an idea which has
occupied a central place in almost every generation of Japanese literature. Paradoxically, the spectacle of destruction has given birth to some of the most beautiful, most moving,
and most powerfully thrilling literature in the Japanese tradition. Texts may be drawn from medieval war narratives like The Tale of the Heike; World War II fiction and films by
Ibuse Masuji, Imamura Shôhei, and Ichikawa Kon; fantasy and science fiction novels by Abe Kôbô, Murakami Haruki and Murakami Ryû; and apocalyptic comics and animation by Oshii Mamoru, Ôtomo Katsuhiro, and others. The class and the readings are in English; no familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.

COMP 266(S) Confession and Deception in Japanese Literature (Same as JAPN 256)
Situated at the origins of Japanese literature are the beautiful and revealing diaries of ladies in waiting at the tenth- and eleventh-century court. Yet one of the most famous of these
women turned out to be a man. For the next thousand years, Japanese literary tradition would place a premium on confessional writing, but the distortions and concealments of
these narrators (and the authors hiding behind them) would always prove at least as interesting as the revelations. This course examines several centuries of Japanese literature to
ask whether you can ever put your true self into writing; along the way I will ask you what you reveal, conceal, discover, or reinvent about yourself when you write about
literature for a class like this. Texts will range from classical and medieval court literature by Sei Shônagon and Lady Nijô, through autobiographical and confessional novels by
Sôseki, Tanizaki, Mishima, and Abe Kôbô, to documentary and subculture films like The New God and Kamikaze Girls. The class and the readings are in English; no familiarity
with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance and participation, 2 or 3 short response assignments, one test, two 5-page papers, and an ungraded creative project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference given to students majoring or considering a major in Comparative Literature

COMP 284(S) The Concept of Bildung: the Literature and Philosophy of Self–Discovery
This course traces the influential concept of {Bildung}, or self–discovery, through the literature and philosophy of Germany, England, France, and other traditions, from the
Enlightenment to the present. At the time of the French Revolution and amid the general fervor for democratic self–rule that it represented, a handful of German philosophers
asked themselves a simple and yet profound question: If modern individuals could free themselves from dogmatic belief and from the political and cultural institutions that such
belief supported, what new aesthetic, social, and political forms could express and support this freedom, and how might these new forms be discovered and maintained? The
famously untranslatable concept of Bildung, whose meaning spans notions of education, cultivation, self–discovery, and self–actualization, was a response to this question that
would inform joint projects of scientific discovery, artistic self–expression, and political self–determination well beyond the borders of Germany, and to the present day. Through
careful analysis of key texts from this tradition, students will explore how representations of Bildung reflect changing ideas about identity, agency, pleasure, knowledge, and
power. Readings will include literary works by writers like Goethe, C. Brontë, Wordsworth, Flaubert, Wilde, Equiano, Fanon, and Coetzee, in combination with critical and
philosophical texts by figures like Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Freud.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one 5- to 7-page and one 8- to 10-page paper, a few other short writing assignments, and one in-class presentation

COMP 308 Everyday Life in Literature and Film (Same as WGSS 309) (Not offered 2013-2014)
To bring the all too familiar everyday to our attention, artists and writers have made it strange. What happens when we view everyday life from elsewhere? While everyday
culture has often been experienced as repressive and alienating in modern Western societies, a new importance assigned to everyday life made it liberating in Japan during the
twenties and in contemporary China. The contours of the everyday are delightfully vague, and it always exceeds theorizing. For instance, is its privileged place the street or the
home? Is it lived largely in institutions that regulate our daily lives, or is it lived between and outside them? Everyday objects and commodities like the potato, the postcard, the
car, clothes, housing, etc., will be analyzed. Fiction by Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Georges Perec, Manil Suri, Ha Jin, and Banana Yoshimoto. Films by Chantal Akerman, Pedro
Almodovar, Benoit Jaquot, and Pierre Jeunet. Art projects that transform the everyday will also be discussed, including those of Sophie Calle, Mary Kelley, Mierle Laderman
Ukeles, and Christine Hill. Short theoretical excerpts from Freud, Kracauer, Goffman, Lefebvre, de Beauvoir, Friedan, Debord, Foucault, and Bourdieu. All works not originally
in English will be read in English translation.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two short oral reports on everyday objects and their history, two 3- to 5-page papers, and a 10- to 12-page final paper or creative
project.
Prerequisites: one 200-level literature course. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to students majoring in Comparative Literature.

The British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott once wrote: “It is a joy to be hidden, and a disaster not to be found.” This course will explore the many ways in which writing enacts
this paradox, examining in the process several main strands of psychoanalytic thought in relation to literature that precedes, accompanies, and follows it in history. Approximately
the first three-fourths of the course will involve close readings of theoretical and literary texts, which will be shared in a seminar format. In the latter portion of the course, students
will work with each other and with the instructor on analyzing the processes of reading and writing as they produce original psychoanalytic readings of texts of their choice. All
readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active engagement with the material and with each other; reading journal; two shorter papers, and one final paper that will first be
presented orally in a conference format, then expanded and revised into a longer paper.

In the past 25 years, we have seen an extraordinary boom in museum, memorial and monument building around the world. In this class, we will explore what this growth means
to cultural practices of memory and global politics. We will explore questions posed by leading scholars in museum and cultural studies such as: Why is there a “global rush to
commemorate atrocities” (Paul Williams)? Why do we live in a “voracious museal culture” and how does this impact our ability to imagine the future (Andreas Huyssen)? We
look at museum history and recent museum controversies. We will analyze debates surrounding memorials and monuments. In addition to our work on institutions, we will also
read a number of novels that claim to do the work of museums (Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence) and that interrupt processes of memorialization (Amy Waldman’s
The Submission).
Format: seminar. Requirements: response papers, case studies and a final essay.

Cultural encounters entail a questioning of identity, values and worldview. As the familiar gives way to the unknown, issues of knowledge and power can begin to influence the
interaction between different groups. In this course we will examine texts dealing with differences in language, religion, race, class, gender and citizenship that lead to the
formation of allegiances and rivalries. What constitutes a cultural group? How is difference determined? What is the nature of the tension characteristic of many a cross-cultural
encounter? How do cultural hybridity and conflicting solidarities influence multi-cultural dialogues? Readings for this course include Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Namesake, Nelida

COMP 350 Cervantes’ Don Quixote in English Translation (Same as ENGL 308 and RLSP 303) (Not offered 2013-2014)
A close study of one of the most influential and early European novels. Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616 C.E) was a hit in its day in the seventeenth century, and
has not ceased to influence artists and thinkers since. Moving between humorous and serious tones, Cervantes takes on several issues in the Quixote: the point of fiction in real
life, the complications of relationships between men and women, the meaning of madness, the experience of religious co-existence, the shapes of friendship, and the task of
literary criticism, just to name a few. We will read the book in a fine modern English-language translation, and set it in several relevant contexts to better understand its original
intellectual horizon—seventeenth-century Spain—as well as the reasons for its continuing relevance.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on active participation, three short papers, and a final project designed in consultation with the instructor.
Prerequisites: any 200-level literature course in foreign languages, COMP, or ENGL, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to
Comparative Literature majors and upperclass students.

This course will consider different kinds of works (poetry, memoirs, fiction, essay) written by authors forced to live in exile as a consequence of political and/or religious persecution. Our point of departure will be the paradigmatic expulsion and subsequent diaspora of the Jews of Spain and Portugal. Most assignments, however, will be drawn from
twentieth century texts written during, or in the wake of, the massive destruction and displacements brought about by the Spanish Civil War and World War II. How is the life lost
portrayed? How are the concepts of home and the past intertwined? What kind of life or literature are possible for the deracinated survivor? We will discuss the role of writing and
remembrance in relation to political history, as well as in the context of individual survival. Readings might include works by Nuñez de Reinoso, León, Cernuda, Semprún,
Benjamin, Nancy, and Blanchot.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing assignments, a midterm paper and a final paper.

COMP 380(F) Literary and Critical Theory in the Twentieth Century (Same as ENGL 370)
From the rise of modern literary criticism around 1900 to the explosion of high theory in the 1980s and 1990s, the twentieth century witnessed an international flowering of new
ideas about how to interpret art and literature: Russian Formalism, American New Criticism, French Structuralism and Deconstruction, new varieties of hermeneutic criticism,
and a welter of post- prefixed concepts that claim to transcend national boundaries: the poststructural, the postmodern, the postcolonial, the posthuman. What are the ideas
associated with these different movements, and how are they connected? Does each represent a radical break with previous ways of reading, or do they actually build on one
another and evolve in a systematic way? The course will focus on careful reading of essays representing major 20th-century critical schools (and a couple of their earlier precursors), by critics like Schiller, Shklovsky, I.A. Richards, Barthes, Derrida, Said, and others. Written assignments will encourage you to parse these theories carefully and apply
them to the literary texts that most interest you: prose or poetry from any time and place; film, visual art, or architecture; music, new media, or digital media, etc.
Format:seminar. Requirements: attendance and active participation, several short response assignments summarizing and applying the theory, and a final project consisting of a
scripted oral presentation plus a final 15-page paper.
Prerequisites: at least one previous literature or theory course. Enrollment:15 (expected:12). Preference: students majoring in a related discipline.

COMP 401(F) Senior Seminar: Detective Fiction
Despite the genre’s comparative youth, detective fiction has proven unusually adaptable and stunningly prolific. In the less than 200 years since its inception, detective fiction has
traveled to virtually every region of the globe and into countless languages, found a home in both high art and popular culture, penetrated media including print, cinema, the
internet, and the iPhone app, and spawned subgenres as sundry and specific as the police procedural, cooking detective fiction, medieval monk detective fiction, and lesbian
detective fiction. This seminar seeks to understand the genre’s explosion in the wake of Edgar Allan Poe’s seminal stories by surveying the diverse material that falls within its
capacious generic boundaries, as well as work by those who theorize detective fiction. In addition to reading classics by Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie, we will
explore texts that use the detective and the activity of detection in innovative ways (for example, Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment), watch several works of film noir, and see
what happens when the detective gets self–consciously conceptual in works by writers such as Jorge Luis Borges and Paul Auster. All readings will be in English; however,
students able to read translated works in the original language are encouraged to do so.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, occasional short writing assignments and presentations in class, a final research paper.
Prerequisites: a 300–level literature course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-12). Preference given to senior Comparative Literature majors

Chair, Associate Professor STEPHEN N. FREUND
Professors: BAILEY, DANYLUK, LENHART, MURTAGH. Associate Professors: FREUND, HEERINGA*, MCGUIRE*. Assistant Professor: ALBRECHT.
Computers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as diverse as education, science, business, and the arts. Understanding
the nature of computation and exploring the great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas of research investigated by the

113

Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range of topics that are of interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes:
the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make transmission of information over
the Internet possible; the design of revolutionary new computer languages that simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of machine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex for humans to analyze; algorithms that can solve problems that were
previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of machine architectures and specific
hardware aimed at making computing fast.
The department recognizes that students’ interests in computer science will vary widely. The department attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) the major; (2) a
selection of courses intended for those who are interested primarily in an introduction to computer science; (3) recommended course sequences for the non-major who wants a
more extensive introduction to computer science in general or who seeks to develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline.

MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the conceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on
them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas underlying these principles. The introductory
and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas including
graphics, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, networks, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work provide opportunities for students
to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to pursue a wide variety of career opportunities. It can be used as preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or
to provide important background and techniques for the student whose future career will extend outside of computer science.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of
these must be a course designated as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis courses) will normally not
be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the department to waive this restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 200 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics or Statistics course at the 200-level or higher
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134 and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in
particular that Discrete Mathematics covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequisite for many advanced
courses.
Students who take Computer Science 102T, 107, or 109 may use that course as one of the two electives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count
Computer Science 109 toward the major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project course. Computer Science 102T,
107, 109, and 134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science 136 as well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the sophomore year.
A second Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core courses
(Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior
year.
All senior majors must attend and participate in the Computer Science Colloquium. With the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics or statistics
courses may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Appropriate mathematics classes are those numbered 300 or above, and appropriate statistics courses are those
numbered 200 or above. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in
consultation with the department.

LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students taking Computer Science courses, as well as a lab that can be configured
for teaching specialized topics such as robotics. The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty research in computer science.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to students who have demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study extending beyond the
requirements of the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong academic
records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year
to arrange a program of study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research
under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis that is judged acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of
written work and often includes a major computer program. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their research in the Computer Science Colloquium
in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the
beginning of the spring semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors work. Recommendations for the
degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional
ability, achievement, or originality.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of four introductory courses-Computer Science 102: The Socio-Techno Web, 107: Creating Games, 109: The Art and Science of Computer
Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing computer programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level
courses in the department. As a result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most advanced courses in the department.
Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to take 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about exciting new ideas in computer science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills, should
consider Computer Science 102: The Socio-Techno Web, 107: Creating Games, or 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics.
Students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see “Advanced Placement” below). Students are always welcome to
contact a member of the department for guidance in selecting a first course.

STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses while abroad should discuss their plans in advance with the chair of the
department. Students who plan to study away but do not expect to take courses toward the major should work with the department to create a plan to ensure that they will be able
to complete the major. While study abroad is generally not an impediment to completing the major, students should be aware that certain computer science courses must be taken
in a particular sequence and that not all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students who wish to discuss their plans are invited to meet with any of the faculty in
Computer Science.

ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the exam
is normally required for advanced placement in Computer Science 136.

114

Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such students
should have had a good course in computer science using a structured language such as Java.

PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines
outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our department’s curriculum ranging from
two-course sequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing
such a plan of study are invited to discuss their plans in detail with a member of the faculty. To assist students making such plans, we include some suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the department are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In
particular, the four core courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science. Students seeking a concentration in
Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a
total of five Computer Science courses and one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 followed by 136 and 256 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure design together with an understanding of issues of
correctness and efficiency. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer Science 134 at a minimum, and should also consider Computer Science 136
and 256. The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students interested in applying such
knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more expertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a
four-course sequence.
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the department chair or other members of the department’s faculty.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.

Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 102T, 107, 109, 315, 336T, 337T, 339, 356T, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434T are each normally offered every other year. All other Computer Science
courses are normally offered every year.

Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series,
numeric order does not indicate the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-level courses) generally indicates the
area of computer science covered by the course.

Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information on the offerings in the department is available at http://www.cs.williams.edu.

Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken pass-fail, though courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy
any of the major or honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail
basis.

CSCI 102T The Socio-Techno Web (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
This course introduces many fundamental concepts in computer science by examining the social aspects of computing. As more and more people use the technologies and
services available via the Internet, online environments like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and blogs are flourishing. However, several of the problems related to security,
privacy, and trust that exist in the real world transfer and become amplified in the virtual world created by the ubiquity and pervasiveness of the Internet. In this course, we will
investigate how the social, technological, and natural worlds are connected, and how the study of networks sheds light on these connections. Topics include the structure of the
Social Web and networks in general; issues such as virtual identity, personal and group privacy, trust evaluation and propagation, and online security; and the technology, economics, and politics of Web information and online communities. No background in computer science or programming is required or expected.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on tutorial discussions, presentations, problem sets and labs, a midterm exam, and a final project or paper
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores who have not previously taken a computer science course.
ALBRECHT

CSCI 107 Creating Games (Same as ARTS 107) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The game is unique as the only broadly-successful interactive art form. Games communicate the experience of embodying a role by manipulating the player’s own decisions,
abstraction, and discrete planning. Those three elements are the essence of computation, which makes computer science theory integral to game design. Video games also co-opt
programming and computer graphics as new tools for the modern artist. As a result, games are collaborative interdisciplinary constructs that use computation as a medium for
creative expression.
Students analyze and extend contemporary video and board games using the methodology of science and the language of the arts. They explore how computational concepts like
recursion, state, and complexity apply to interactive experiences. They then synthesize new game elements using mathematics, programming and both digital and traditional art
tools. Emphasis is on the theory of design in modern European board games. Topics covered include experiment design, gameplay balance, minimax, color theory, pathfinding,
game theory, composition, and computability.
Format: lecture and studio. Requirements: participation, studio work, quizzes.
No prerequisites; not open to students who completed a CSCI course numbered 136 or above; this course does not count toward the Art Major. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:
19).
Preference given to first-year students.
Lab fee of $25 will be added to the student’s term bill.
MCGUIRE

CSCI 109(S) The Art and Science of Computer Graphics (Q)

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: LAURA MCKEON
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an
interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor
modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major—i.e., it must embody a
disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence, a Contract Major usually
consists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of
working within existing majors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experiences with other students working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or two majors, or simply by
working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be
met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major Advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall
semester of the sophomore year, and then—during the sophomore year—follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing departments who expect to be in residence during the student’s senior year and
who are willing to endorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence
faculty sponsors substitute for the student’s major department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and guidelines are available in the Registrar’s Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major
is crucial for obtaining approval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the
senior major course (and taken during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course grades and grade point average
apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including grades received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further develop the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must
submit their endorsement forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program (e.g., Africana Studies, area
studies programs, Environmental Studies), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also submit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity
of the proposal by the end of the fourth week of the spring semester.

117

5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student’s most recent academic progress report, the faculty sponsors’ endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after consultation with departments and
programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each proposal individually and will notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time
needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may permit them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student’s
academic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where
there has been substantial alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student’s written request to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances, a
student may propose to substitute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The Contract Major with honors shall
comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to
fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may
elect not to continue further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to three faculty readers, at least one of
whom shall be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour
oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages relevant to their academic interests but not taught in regular courses at Williams. The
program can field a limited number of courses per year*, and it has offered one–year of elementary Hebrew, Hindi, Korean and Swahili thus far. Students work independently
with standard language textbooks and audio materials for roughly ten hours per week and attend biweekly group review sessions with tutors who are native speakers. Language
faculty from other institutions provide the course syllabus, conduct the exams, and determine the final grades. An organizational meeting for enrolled students is held the first
week of each semester.
Interested students must present an application and have it approved before registering for a course. Applications are available during the first two weeks of April and can be
obtained from the Coordinator at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, Hollander 230.
To be eligible for this 200-level Critical Languages course, the student must:
have attained sophomore standing or higher;
 demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
 explain how the study of the language integrates with his/her major or other academic interests;
 present a letter of support from a Williams faculty member;
 have at least a 3.0 GPA
 in some cases, take a placement test.
Note that like other elementary language courses, the Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the first semester until the second semester is
successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail. An organizational meeting will be held the first week of each
semester.


A consecutive year of intermediate language study will be considered only upon petition of those students completing a full year of elementary study with the Critical Languages Program and as long as a minimum of two students are enrolled to continue their language study.

*A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted for study and provided a native tutor and outside examiner have been contracted.

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject—be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or modernism—to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the
processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis—self-criticism, editing, and revision—with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer
tutoring, small group work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a substantially heightened ability to approach
problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited
enrollment. Because these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic
careers.

The purpose of the Dance Department is to educate students in the physical disciplines, cultural traditions and expressive possibilities of dance. We provide the opportunity to
study and experience dance as technique, composition, history, theory and performance. We do not offer a major or a concentration, yet our courses can offer complementary
study in the disciplines of Theater, Visual Art, Africana Studies, Performance Studies and Music. Technique courses currently offered include ballet, modern, African and Irish
traditions and Pilates.
At the beginning of the fall semester, prior to the beginning of classes, the department will offer a placement workshop to evaluate student accomplishment and determine
which course level is appropriate. Notification of placement will be sent to the student within 24 hours. If a student wishes to pre-register before the placement workshop, he/she
is advised to contact the instructor of the course for advice.
All students are welcome to audition for membership in the Department’s performing companies (CoDa, Kusika, Sankofa, and INISH). Membership is also possible through
invitation by the company directors. Kusika and INISH also accept members as dancers, musicians, singers and storytellers. Members study with faculty, guest artists and peers.
Student choreographers are also supported.
Students may receive PE credit for dance in the following ways: enrolling in a class that is for PE credit only, choosing the PE option in courses offered for academic credit or
PE, or successful participation in CoDa, Kusika, Sankofa, or INISH.
The Department belongs to and attends the American College Dance Festival Association New England Regional where students are able to perform, attend master classes
and audition for scholarships for summer study. Our students also participate in area cultural events and provide workshops, lecture demonstrations and performances for local
schools.

DANC 100(F) Foundations for Dance
This course is a primer of basic dance technique* and an introduction to the history of dance in several cultures and serves as the foundation for all other courses taught in the
Dance Department. Students will study the fundamentals of ballet, modern, Irish and African dance, study the historic and cultural context of these forms, and be introduced to
the intrinsic relation between music and movement. Pilates will be taught to develop the strength and stamina necessary for all dance activities. Regular studio work will be
supplemented with readings, recordings of dance, and discussion.
Format: studio/lecture/discussion. Requirements:evaluation will be based on active participation and progress in the techniques, participation in discussions, and the quality of
written assignments and quizzes/presentations.
No prerequisites. Experienced dancers who wish to enroll in upper level courses may waive the DANC 100 prerequisite by taking the advanced placement class or by permission
of the faculty. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to beginning dancers and students with no prior experience.
*Option: Dance Department ensemble members in good standing may fulfill the studio portion of the course within their weekly ensemble classes and attend seminar sections
only; any ensemble member who drops membership during the semester must remain in company classes to receive credit for DANC 100.

DANC 102(F) Skills (Same as ARTS 110)
Skills is a physical training lab for dancers, actors, performance artists, and anyone interested in expanding their kinesthetic awareness, physical range, perceptual sensitivity, and
ability to communicate and work with others in an embodied way. The course proposes that developing these skills has the potential to ignite, inform and/or complicate one’s
creative practice, social perspectives, and citizenship. The class provides students with highly specific exercises for building strength, flexibility, endurance, and physical range,
while also prioritizing improvisational techniques for moving and vocalizing on our own, with partners, and as a group. Combining these approaches allows us to examine how
the attention, freedom, play, and curiosity of improvisation can illuminate set exercises, and how the specifications and limits of set work might inform and clarify our more
open–ended practice. Skills draws from a variety of approaches including Yoga, Body Weather Laboratory, Contact Improvisation, Jazz Dance, Authentic Movement, Mindfulness Meditation, and the work of La Pocha Nostra, Deborah Hay, and d. Sabela Grimes. We will experiment with repetitive tasks, acts of physical and mental endurance, touch
and trust, blind walks, heightening one’s senses, and composing still and moving bodies in a variety of environments. Some reading will be given in order to contextualize our
practices, and students will complete regular informal writing and a final collaborative project.
Format: studio. Requirements: students will be evaluated on class participation, a weekly written response, and final experiential project.
Prerequisites: previous experience with movement, performance art, theater, and meditation may be useful, but no performing or dance experience is necessary. Enrollment limit:

DANC 205 Modern Masterworks (Not offered 2013-2014)
Some works of art are “instantly” declared masterworks. Others gain this recognition over time, after initial indifference or even hostility. This course will examine select modern
dance masterworks, including works by both the pioneers of modern dance and those by contemporary choreographic masters. Students will develop a critical framework for
understanding dance by examining works both loved and misunderstood in their respective times. By what criteria does a culture define a masterwork? What does the work
reflect about its time, its creator, and the place of dance in society? We will examine topics suggested by the works, such as how the body is constructed/deconstructed in, and by,
the work, religion and spiritual practice in relation to dance-making, the social identity of the creator and the performers, the uses of music/sound in relation to movement
expression, and how we ”read” dances as individuals. Weekly viewings, critical and historic readings and discussion will be accompanied by studio practice in which we explore
movement techniques developed by master creators.
Format: seminar and studio. Requirements: students will be evaluated based upon class participation, weekly written response, and a final research presentation.
Prerequisites:DANC 100or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit:20(expected:20).

DANC 302(F) Experimental Choreography/Ways of Working
Conceptual and visual artists in Europe and the U.S. have long borrowed techniques and aesthetics from their contemporaries in dance and theater. In the 1960s the Judson Dance
Theater and other dance makers often took cues from their colleagues in visual art and music. Today there is a renewed interest in the body and performance in gallery and
museum contexts while at the same time the contemporary dance world is re–visiting interdisciplinary sensibilities and techniques, newly challenging how “dance” can be
defined. Stillness and quotidian action are again being framed as choreography, dancers are using technology and materials to create visual and sonic products from their movements, obsessively repetitive actions and physical exhaustion and endurance, trends long popular in live art/performance, are being re–contextualized by choreographers and/or
in traditional theatrical settings, dance and dancers are regularly performing outside of traditional theaters, and projects featuring humans moving in collaboration with urban and
natural environments are commonplace.
Dismissing the need to determine weather or not a given performance is in fact dance, this course proposes the reclamation of the word choreography to include any movement
(or stillness) of bodies in space and time. Expanding definitions of choreography, the class calls on compositional techniques from dance as well as strategies not traditionally
considered for application to choreography. Through in–class experiential exercises, readings, video and performance viewing (of contemporary and historical work by well–
known and lesser–known artists), discussion, and individual performance–making, the class will employ several interdisciplinary ways of inventing and organizing movement, a
handful of approaches to how a maker transmits ideas to a performer, and a variety of examples of how and for what purpose an artist frames these particular actions and inactions
in a given context. We will look at a number of works categorized within the field of dance, while also considering examples from live/performance art, conceptual practice,
music/sound, installation and sculpture. Students will make several performances, working on their own as solo performers, as directors of group projects, and as a collaborative
team of makers.
Format: studio. Requirements: students will be evaluated on class participation, regular written and choreographic assignments, and final research/performance project.
Prerequisites: expierence in dance, theater, performance, video or literary arts. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to juniors and seniors; if over enrolled
instructor may ask for statement of interest.

GENERAL INFORMATION
The primary objectives of the economics major are to develop an understanding of how individuals, organizations and societies meet their material needs. The introductory
courses present the fundamental principles of economics at a level that is useful for understanding a wide range of social and policy issues. The core theory courses provide a
more rigorous grounding in the tools used in analyzing individual choice, the functioning of markets, and the behavior of output, employment, and inflation. The econometrics
course familiarizes students with the methods used to analyze economic data, and equip them with the tools necessary to critique and conduct empirical research. The electives
draw on the skills developed in the introductory and core courses to gain a richer understanding of specific aspects of economic behavior and public policy.
The Economics major and business careers. The analytical and critical thinking skills taught in economics classes are useful for many careers, including business. The major
is not designed to provide pre-professional training in business or management, however. Students from a wide variety of majors, including the sciences and humanities, have

120

gone on to successful business careers. We therefore advise those interested in business to acquire a broad exposure to the arts, social science, and natural sciences, and to major in
a subject that engages their interest even if that subject is something other than Economics.
Preparation for graduate school. Graduate study in economics requires considerably more mathematical sophistication than it does at the undergraduate level. We advise
students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. to take at a minimum MATH 105 or 106, MATH 209, MATH 211, and MATH 301. We also advise students to consider electives
such as Econ 451 and 475 that present advanced perspectives on contemporary economic theory. As graduate schools look for evidence of research aptitude, we also encourage
those interested in graduate school to pursue the Honors program.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Except for those receiving AP, IB, or A-level credit (see below), nine courses are required for the Economics major. These are:

Introductory courses
 Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
 Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics. Prerequisite: ECON 110
Passing the quantitative studies exam or the equivalent is a prerequisite for both classes. Both are suitable for non-majors. Electives numbered 200-299 will require one or both
as prerequisites.

Core courses
 Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory. Prerequisites: MATH 103 and ECON 110
 Economics 252 Macroeconomics. Prerequisites: MATH 103, ECON 110 and ECON 120
 Economics 255 Econometrics. Prerequisites: MATH 103 plus either STAT 101 or 201. The combination of STAT 201 and 346 will satisfy the ECON 255 requirement. ECON/POEC 253 may not substitute for ECON 255.
The three core classes may be taken in any order. All of the 300- and 400-level electives will require at least one of the core classes, and most of the 400-level seminars require
Econ 255. Students are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the core courses by the end of junior year. Note that since either Stat 101 or 201 is required for Econ 255,
students should plan to satisfy the statistics prerequisite early in their college careers.

Electives
Students must complete at least four economics electives in addition to the introductory and core classes listed above. At least two must be advanced electives numbered 350
to 395. At least one must be a seminar numbered 450-475, and a second seminar may be taken in lieu of a 300-level elective. Enrollment preference for 400-level classes is
given to those who have not already taken a seminar. Note that some of the advanced electives may have specific requirements beyond the core economics courses and MATH
103. Juniors and seniors majoring in Economics or Political Economy may, with the permission of the instructor, enroll in 500-level graduate courses given by the Center for
Development Economics. These courses can substitute for advanced electives numbered 350-395.
Credit for AP, IB and A-level exams
 The Econ 110 requirement will be waived for students who earned a 5 on the microeconomics AP exam, and the Econ 120 requirement will be waived for those who
received a 5 on the macroeconomics AP exam. Students satisfying either criterion will receive major credit for the course and may complete the major with either eight or
seven additional courses, depending on whether they place out of one or both introductory courses. These would include the introductory course for which no advanced
placement was granted, the three core classes, and the four required electives.

 Students who received an A on the A-level exam in economics or earned a 6 or 7 in the higher economics IB exam will receive credit for both Econ 110 and 120, and may
complete the major with only seven additional courses. These would include the three core classes and the four required electives.
 A score of 5 on the statistics AP exam, a 6 or a 7 on the statistics IB exam, or an A on the A-level statistics exam will satisfy the statistics prerequisites for ECON 255.

STUDY ABROAD AND TRANSFER CREDIT
Students may receive credit for college courses taken at other institutions, including those taken as part of a study abroad program. Most economics courses taken elsewhere
will qualify for 200-level elective credit. Some may be able to count towards a specific departmental requirement, or qualify as a 300-level elective. In order to receive the
appropriate credit, courses must be approved ahead of time by the Department’s Coordinator for Transfer/Study Abroad Credit. (The Department’s web site will indicate which
faculty member is serving as the Coordinator.)

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
Graduating with Honors requires the completion of a substantial piece of independent research. Those with an economics GPA of at least 3.5 are encouraged to apply. In
addition, because theses typically make use of empirical methods, those considering writing a thesis are strongly advised to complete Econ 255 before the end of junior year.
The honors program involves working closely with a faculty adviser on a subject related to the faculty member’s area of expertise. The first step in pursuing honors is therefore
to develop a thesis proposal in consultation with a faculty adviser. The proposal is then submitted to the Department for approval.
The Department offers both a half-year and a full-year honors program:

 The half-year program entails enrolling in a one-semester seminar plus a WSP class. Students may either enroll in Econ 491 in the fall semester and Econ 31 during
winter study, or they may take Econ 31 during winter study and Econ 492 in the spring. Proposals for a fall semester thesis are due in May of the junior year, while those
doing a spring thesis will submit their proposals in December of the senior year. Those choosing the half-year often base their projects on research that had been
initiated in an advanced elective or a seminar, although this is not a requirement.
 The full-year program involves taking Econ 493 in the fall, Econ 31 during winter study, and Econ 494 in the spring. Proposals are due in May of the junior year.
Both programs require students to remain on campus during winter study.
Prospective honors students considering studying abroad during their junior year should plan to complete the core courses and at least one 300-level elective by the end of their
sophomore year. They are also urged to begin their collaboration with their intended adviser prior to departure, and to consult with the Director of Research on the options for
pursuing honors. (The Department’s web site will indicate which faculty member is serving as the Director of Research.)
Further details on the two routes, the application procedure and deadlines are contained in memos sent to economics majors in the spring and fall semesters. The information is
also available on the Department’s web site.
In addition to completing the research project, the College Bulletin states that in order to graduate with honors, students must take at least one course in addition to the
minimum number required for the major. Students in the full-year program may substitute Econ 493 for an upper-level elective (excluding those numbered 400-490). Students
enrolled in the half-year program may not substitute Econ 491 or 492 for one of their electives.

ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for
labor, and markets for natural resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implications of both their successes and failures.
The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This course is required of
Economics and Political Economy majors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental Studies and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies. The
department recommends that students follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has ECON 110 as its prerequisite. Students may
alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after taking this introductory course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, quizzes, short essays, midterm, final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).

ECON 203(S) Gender and Economics (Same as WGSS 205)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic outcomes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be
covered include: How does the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the household? How have changes in family
structure affected women’s employment, and vice-versa? What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice, and earnings?
What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How successful are government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., comparable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the current experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender
differences in a historical and cross-cultural context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly discussion papers, two midterms, and a final paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: ECON 110. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF

to reduce poverty? Topics include agricultural productivity, health, education, microfinance, child labor, corruption, and intellectual property rights. We shall also discuss the
extent to which market-friendly reforms (such as trade liberalization) can reduce poverty.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short papers and exams.
Prerequisites: ECON 110. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected 35). If overenrolled, preference to sophomores.

ECON 205 Public Economics (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course examines the role of the government in a market economy. Three broad issues are considered: when is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is
the most effective form of intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will cover issues in both taxation and spending. Specific
programs will be considered such as Social Security, Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strategies for reforming the U.S.
tax system.

ECON 213 Introduction to Environmental and Natural Resources Economics (Same as ENVI 213) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Economists love free markets, but many people fear that market-driven economic growth and consumption are endangering the natural environment. In fact, core economic
theories predict that people and firms, left to their own devices, will often tend to pollute too much, conserve too little, overfish common waters, and cut down too many trees.
These predictions seem to be borne out by the world’s environmental problems. Fortunately, economics offers tools to address these issues, and these tools are increasingly
gaining attention in the policy world. In this course, we will survey environmental and natural resource economics, fields that work to inform policy with attention to both natural
assets and human needs. We will focus on real-world problems, mostly from a microeconomic perspective. Underlying issues in these fields include: why markets might be
inefficient where the environment and natural resources are concerned; whether and how to value the benefits we receive from the environment; and how to carefully evaluate
policies. We will study the economists’ perspective on sustainability and we’ll discuss how sustainability, growth, and human wellbeing relate to each other. We will study the use
of non-renewable resources (like oil) and renewable resources (like trees and fish), and we will spend some time talking about energy and energy policy. We will examine issues
related to pollution, looking at traditional “command and control” regulations and at market-based pollution control policies. Climate change is a pressing global problem, and we
will study current and proposed climate policies and the role economics can play. We may cover other topics, including international development, food, agriculture, and water.

we will focus on China, Japan, Korea, and a few Southeast Asian countries. Those interested in economic development and applied microeconomic policies characteristic of East
Asia will find this course useful. We first examine the process of economic growth. Cross country comparisons will help draw similarities but also differences in the development
processes. The second part of the course will focus on specific economic issues such as, privatization in China, education and inequality in South Korea, demographic challenges
in Japan, health care in Indonesia, etc. The course will involve readings from various texts, policy reports, academic journals, and case studies. Throughout the course students
will learn how to read empirical evidence presented in these articles.

ECON 219T Global Economic History (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Why did Western Europe—and not China, India, or the Middle East—first experience the Industrial Revolution? Why did Latin America fall behind in the 20th century? Why
have the countries of East Asia recently experienced such high rates of economic growth? And why has Africa remained so poor for so long? These and other questions will
guide our exploration of world economic development over the past several millennia. We will draw on micro and macroeconomic theory to help explain and interpret the
historical roots of the modern global economy. Our focus will be broadly comparative across space and time, with an emphasis on how institutions, resource endowments,
cultural and technological revolutions, and market developments have driven economic changes.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 7-page papers, critiques of fellow students’ papers, a longer

What economic forces influence the creation, presentation, preservation and ownership of art and culture? Should support for the arts be provided through private patronage,
private philanthropy, or public sector support? How does the mechanism of support for art affect the productivity and creativity of the artist? Does art make a good investment for
an individual? How do art markets function and what determines the price of art? Why do some art museums and performing arts organizations require donations and public
support and operate as non-profit enterprises, while other types of culture production and preservation operate as for-profit enterprise? What are the impacts on economic vitality
and local economic development of cultural and arts organizations? When these impacts arise, how can (or should) they be used for public policy? This course will use the tools
of economic analysis to present a framework for discussion and analysis of these and related questions.

ECON 225T Global Financial Crisis and African Economic Development (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Will the global financial crunch create a development crisis for Africa? Just two years ago the International Monetary Fund published the most optimistic growth projections for
Africa in decades, predicting rapid growth driven by higher commodity prices, stronger agricultural output and the dividends of years of difficult economic reforms. Today,
economic analysts are downgrading African growth forecasts in the face of growing poverty and macroeconomic challenges. Food prices have more than doubled in some
countries—increasing hunger for the most vulnerable groups. Fuel costs—and subsidy policies in some countries—are creating macroeconomic imbalances, and the global
financial crisis is depressing demand for Africa s exports. Private capital flows, which reached record levels until 2007, are expected to decline by $300-400 billion over the next
two years, with bank lending falling, portfolio investment declining, and foreign direct investment decreasing. This triple-F crisis—food, fuel and financial—is posing renewed
challenges to African leaders trying to tackle the imperatives of economic development and pro-poor and inclusive economic growth. This crisis is raising the costs of reforms in
countries reliant on exports and international capital for growth. Successful strategies must combine policies more efficiently than ever—to balance the necessary reforms with
initiatives that offset the costs for the most vulnerable. This tutorial will analyze critical questions posed by the emerging crisis: Which countries will be hit the hardest, and how
deeply and for how long? Through which channels does the contagion afflict national economies? And perhaps most importantly, what coordinated strategies can African
nations develop in order to foster effective responses? This tutorial will explore how policy-makers in Africa are working to build successful inclusive growth strategies, with
fiscal, monetary, industrial, trade and labor market policies reinforcing each other rather than working at cross purposes.
Format: tutorial, will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two. Evaluation will be based on five short papers and on the quality of the student’s oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.
Prerequisites: ECON 252 (or concurrently) or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10).

ECON 228T(S) Water as a Scarce Resource (Same as ENVI 228T) (W)
This course satisfies the “Environmental Policy” requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.
For a variety of reasons including environmental pollution, urbanization, changing agricultural techniques, resource mismanagement, and the consequences of climate change,
water is becoming a scarce resource even in places where it was relatively plentiful in the past, and it is likely to become an increasingly scarce resource over the coming decades.
In this course we will use basic economic models to consider policy issues relating to water: Is access to water a basic human right, and if so, what market and non-market
mechanisms should play a role in water allocation? Does public ownership of water improve the way it is provided and used? Why do societies differ in their approaches to
allocating water and are some systems better than others? What does it mean to have a property right to water? Could private property rights to water help address the water
pollution problem? How can societies change their water-related property rights, regulations and social institutions when individuals have implicit or explicit rights to the institutional status quo? Who has the right to water that crosses international boundaries? How should societies allocate water across generations?
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Requirements: write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), prepare and present
a written critique of their partners’ papers in alternate weeks, and revise and re-write one of their five papers. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the papers and on the
quality of the student’s oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.
Prerequisites: ECON 110 or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to first year students and sophomores intending to major in Economics
and/or to concentrate in Environmental Studies.

ECON 229 Law and Economics (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
This course applies the tools of microeconomic analysis to both private (i.e., civil) and criminal law. This analysis has both positive and normative aspects. The positive aspects
deal with how individuals respond to the incentives created by the legal system. Examples include: how intellectual property law encourages the creation of knowledge while
simultaneously restricting the dissemination of intellectual property; how tort law motivates doctors to avoid malpractice suits; and how criminal law deters criminal activity. The
normative aspects of the analysis ask whether legal rules enhance economic efficiency (or, more broadly, social welfare). Examples include: what legal rules are most appropriate
for mitigating pollution, ensuring safe driving, and guaranteeing workplace safety? The course will also cover the economics of legal systems; for example, what are the incentives for plaintiffs to initiate lawsuits and what role do lawyers play in determining outcomes. The course will also consider potential reforms of the legal system.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets, short papers based on actual court cases and possible legal reforms, a midterm exam,
and a final exam.
Prerequisite: ECON 110. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 25). Preference given to majors and sophomores if overenrolled.

ECON 230(S) The Economics of Health and Health Care (W)
In recent years, the intersection between health and economics has increased in importance. The costs of health care have been rising, seemingly inexorably. A substantial
fraction of the United States population lacks health insurance, while the rising number of elderly is putting increasing pressure on health spending. Globally, the HIV/AIDS
pandemic is causing severe economic hardship, and many people lack access to basic health care. More positively, advances in health care have widened the scope of possible
treatments. Given the importance of good health for individual well-being, it is not surprising that health care and how to pay for it are of concern to individuals and policymakers
worldwide. In this course we will analyze the economics of health by applying standard microeconomic techniques to the problems of health and health care markets. The course
focuses on three broad issues: the inputs to health and the demand for health care, the structure and consequences of public and private health insurance, and the supply of health
care. Special attention will be devoted to topics of current public policy, including the problems of rising costs and cost containment, health insurance reform, the changing nature
of health care provision, changing public policies in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, hospital competition, and the determinants and consequences of technological change
in medicine.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short papers and a final research paper and presentation.

ECON 235 Urban Centers and Urban Systems (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Cities, systems of cities, and the interactions between cities are the outcome of human decisions and reflect their social structure and desire for interaction. The form of these
urban areas is determined by the choices made by the people who reside in, work in, and travel between cities. Economic forces influence and constrain these choices, and
economic models of decision-making can help us to explain and predict the patterns that result. These models help us to comprehend the structure of urban areas. This course will
introduce the ideas and some of the analytic tools that assist in understanding the economic foundations of urban centers and urban systems. Topics addressed in the course will
include the determinants of land use, location of firms, choice of transportation mode, flows of capital investment into real estate, housing prices and housing availability and
regulation of housing markets, movement of population from one city to another, and public policies designed to deal with urban problems.

ECON 240T Colonialism and Underdevelopment in South Asia (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
British colonial rule in South Asia shaped economy and society in fundamental ways. As resistance to colonial rule emerged in the late nineteenth century, “nationalist” writers
developed a critique of its economic impact via taxation, fiscal policy, trade, and many other policies. In their turn, supporters of British rule, “apologists,” argued that British rule
had laid the foundations of economic growth by securing property rights, enforcing contracts, and developing infrastructure. The debate between “nationalists” and “apologists”
has never quite ended, but after the recent growth of the Indian economy it has lost some of its emotional charge. We will use this opportunity to not only examine the economic
questions, but also how power and its contestations have shaped the answers provided. Therefore, the course part of the college’s Exploring Diversity Initiative.

ECON 351 Tax Policy (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q) (W)
The tax system is a major element of public policy. In addition to raising revenue for government expenditure programs, policymakers use the tax system to redistribute resources
and to promote a variety of economic policies. For example, the United States tax system has specific rules to encourage savings, education, and investment. Inherently, many tax
policy choices involve trade-offs between equity and efficiency. The purpose of this course is to clarify the goals and possibilities of tax policy, mainly through an examination of
U.S. federal tax policy (though the search for possible reforms may lead us to examine policies from other countries). The course will examine the choice of the tax base (income
or consumption), notations of fairness in taxation (e.g., the rate structure), the choice to tax corporate income separately from personal income, and a variety of specific tax policy
issues (e.g., retirement saving, child care, the “marriage” tax, capital gains taxation, and the taxation of housing).

ECON 374T Poverty and Public Policy (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Since 1965, the annual poverty rate in the United States has hovered between 10 and 15 percent, though far more than 15 percent of Americans experience poverty at some point
in their lives. In this course, we will study public policies that, explicitly or implicitly, have as a goal improving the well-being of the poor in this country. These policies include
safety net programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Food Stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance), education programs
(Head Start and public primary and secondary education), and parts of the tax code (the Earned Income Tax Credit). We will explore the design and functioning of these programs, focusing on questions economists typically ask when evaluating public policy: Does the policy achieve its goals? Does the design of the policy lead to unintended effects
(either good or bad)? Could it be redesigned to achieve its goals in a more cost-effective manner? Through in-depth study of these programs, students will learn how economists
bring theoretical models and empirical evidence to bear on important questions of public policy.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page papers and on the quality of the student’s oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.

ECON 378(S) Long-Run Perspectives on Economic Growth (Q)
The world today is marred by vast inequities, with about a 30-fold difference in per capita incomes between the poorest country and the most affluent. What explanations do
long-run growth economists have to offer for these differences in levels of prosperity? Are the explanations to be found in underlying differences between countries during the
past few decades? The past few centuries? Or the past few millennia? If contemporary differences in living standards have origins that are hundreds or even thousands of years in
the past, what scope exists for policies to reduce global inequality? Can we expect these inequalities to be reduced gradually over time through natural economic processes, or are
they likely to persist unless action is taken to reduce them? This course will present a unified theory of economic growth for thinking about these and related questions. Examples
of issues to be covered include, amongst other topics, Malthusian stagnation in pre-industrial societies, the importance of the demographic transition and human capital formation
in the process of industrialization, the role of colonialism, slavery and ethnic fragmentation in shaping modern institutions, and the long-lasting effect of geography through its
impact on the emergence of agriculture in early human societies.

ECON 383 Cities, Regions and the Economy (Not offered 2013-2014)
Cities and urbanization can have significant impacts on the economy. In many developed economies, a process of regional decline is associated with older, industrial cities. In
developing countries, the process of economic growth is generally associated with increasing urbanization. Urbanization, with its increasing concentration of population and
production, puts particular pressure on markets to allocate resources for provision of land, housing, transportation, labor and public goods. Urbanization can alter the productivity
of land, labor, and capital in ways that can improve the welfare of residents and the performance of the broader economy. In this course we will examine these conflicting
economic forces and examine some recent research that contributes to our understanding of the difference between regional growth and decline, and the role that the urban
structure plays in these processes. We will examine the function of land, housing, transportation, and labor markets in the urban context, and the scope for public policies to
improve the performance of the regional economy.

ECON 386 Environmental Policy and Natural Resource Management (Same as ECON 518 and ENVI 386) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Policymakers in developed and developing countries struggle to manage natural resources and to protect the environment from excessive degradation while attending to pressing
human needs. Economics has a rich body of advice to help achieve these goals. In this course, we will study environmental policy and natural resource management from a
microeconomic (and, to a lesser extent, macroeconomic) perspective. We will explore relevant economic theory, look for empirical evidence in scholarly studies, and study actual
policies as they have been implemented. The course is undergirded by concepts like sustainability, welfare within and across generations, market failure, and valuation of environmental assets. We will continually emphasize issues of efficiency and equity. Again and again we will see that the challenges are both technical and ethical, as society is forced
to make troubling tradeoffs. Topics in the class will include pollution (with a focus on climate change and on incentive-based policies like tax and “cap-and-trade“), management
of nonrenewable and renewable resources (including resources like oil, forests, and fisheries), and energy (with its obvious links to resource use and climate change). We will also
examine the relationship between development and the environment, touching on controversial topics such as the ”natural resources curse” and the relationship between economic growth and the demand for environmental quality.
Format: seminar. Requirements: problem sets, paper, brief presentation, a midterm, and a final exam.

ECON 388(S) Urbanization and Development (Same as ECON 517 and ENVI 388)
At current rates of growth, the combined population of urban areas in developing countries will double in the next 30 years. The land area devoted to urban use is expected to
double even more quickly. The costs of providing housing and infrastructure to accommodate this growth are enormous, but the costs of failing to accommodate urban development may be even larger. The decisions made in response to these challenges will affect the economic performance of these countries and the health and welfare of the urban
residents. By affecting global patterns of energy use, these decisions will have broader impacts on the entire planet. This course will focus on these challenges. What are the
economic forces that drive the process of urbanization, and how does the level of urbanization affect economic development? How are policies towards housing, transportation,
public finance and development affected by urbanization? What policy choices are available, and which are most likely to succeed in dealing with the challenges of urban
growth?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and a final exam, plus a paper that evaluates specific problems, policy alternatives, and provides some analysis of relevant
data.

ECON 390T Financial Crises: Causes and Cures (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Financial crises have been with us for as long as banking has existed. Why are crises such a regular fixture of societies, and what can be done to prevent them, or at least reduce
their cost? Topics examined include bubbles and swindles, especially when these spill over to the broader macroeconomy; the role of information in banking in normal times and
in bank runs; boom-bust cycles in asset markets; international contagion; crisis resolution techniques; and the extensive history of attempts to improve regulation so as to reduce
the frequency and cost of crises. Crises in developing and developed economies in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries will be examined, and the role of political economy factors in
their run-up and resolution will be featured.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will write 5-6 papers during the term, and will prepare and deliver formal comments on 5-6 papers written by other students.

ECON 391T Economic Analysis of Housing Markets (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Housing is one of the most basic of human needs and the housing market is one of the largest, most important and most heavily regulated markets in national economies around
the world. At various times economists, policy makers and the general public have regarded the housing market as irrational and malfunctioning in a variety of ways. Why? In
this tutorial we will explore and analyze the workings of the housing market. In what ways do housing markets differ from other markets? Why (and how often) do house price
“bubbles” occur? How do mortgage markets function and influence housing markets in countries around the world? In what ways can housing and housing conditions serve as
an indicator of quality of life? How do housing markets affect the sustainability of cities? These and other questions will be the focus of reading and discussion for the course.
Format: tutorial. Each student will write a paper every other week, and comment on his/her partner’s work in the other weeks.

ECON 394(F) European Economic History
Why did modern economic growth first occur in Europe, and not in China or the Middle East? Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in Britain and not France? Why did the
economy of the Soviet Union collapse in the 1980s? What drove European economic integration? This course will explore these and other questions related to the economic
development of Europe from the early modern period until today. We will investigate how institutional change, technology, industrialization, social welfare policies, trade and
globalization, and government intervention have affected the process of economic growth. Drawing on a wide variety of empirical and theoretical readings, the perspective of the
course will be comparative, both across Europe and to the experiences of developing countries today.

ECON 451 Topics in Macroeconomics (Not offered 2013-2014)
This seminar explores some of the central topics in macroeconomics, including economic growth, saving and investment, business cycle fluctuations, monetary policy, and
financial crises. The first part of the course focuses on long-run economic growth. Using economic theory and evidence, we will attempt to answer some of the most important
questions in all of economics: Why are some countries poor and other countries rich? What can governments do to achieve faster and environmentally sustainable rates of
growth? What are the growth consequences of sustained budget deficits? Understanding the behavior of the economy in the long run is one of the key tasks of macroeconomics.
But as we have seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the short run matters as well. In the second part of the class, we will turn our attention to economic downturns and
financial crises. Using historical work on past crises and the accumulating evidence on the current one, we will study a host of short-run topics, including financial markets, the
effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, consumer expectations, asset prices, employment, and productivity. Because this is an advanced class in macroeconomics, we will
approach these issues as practicing economists working with the best possible models and empirical techniques. Students will have an opportunity to apply these methods in a
required end-of-term research paper.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm, final, class participation and research paper.
Prerequisites: ECON 251, 252, and 255.

ECON 453 Research in Labor Economics (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The labor market plays a crucial role in people’s lives worldwide. In industrialized countries, most households contain at least one wage earner, and income from working
represents the largest component of total income. Thus analyses of the labor market are fundamentally relevant to both public policy and private decision-making. This seminar
will explore the structure and functioning of the labor market using theoretical and empirical tools. Topics to be covered include labor supply and demand, minimum wages, labor
market effects of social insurance and welfare programs, the collective bargaining relationship, discrimination, human capital, immigration, wage distribution, and unemployment. As labor economics is an intensely empirical subfield, students will be expected to analyze data as well as study the empirical work of others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a series of short papers and empirical exercises, constructive contributions to class discussion, class presentations, and a 15- to 20-page original

ECON 455 Research in Economic History (Not offered 2013-2014)
Historical approaches to understanding current economic issues are increasingly in vogue. History not only offers laboratories for investigating economic phenomena, but it often
provides excellent empirical material for testing economic theories and analyzing policy decisions. This seminar will explore recent works in economic history, all of which
speak to a current debate in the broader economics profession. Topics to be covered include the role of political change in economic development, education and human capital
accumulation, technology and innovation policies, and the evolution and workings of global factor markets. The focus of the seminar will be on how economic historians marshal
evidence and utilize empirical tools of economics to investigate questions of a historical nature that have modern implications. Students will be expected to not only analyze
recent scholarship in economic history, but they will produce and present their own original research over the semester.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short reading responses and empirical exercises, constructive contributions to class discussion, class presentations, and a 15- to 20-page original
research paper (written in stages).

ECON 456(F) Income Distribution
This course examines the distribution of income in the U.S., with particular emphasis on how it is affected by taxes, transfers, and other government programs. Most of the course
will focus on the bottom of the income distribution, where the role for policy is greatest. Questions to be addressed may include the following: What are the causes and consequences of poverty? How do welfare, the minimum wage, and the EITC affect those in poverty? How does discrimination affect the incomes of various demographic groups?
What are the effects of affirmative action? How much mobility is there across the income distribution? What explains the recent growth in income at the top of the distribution,
and the resulting increase in inequality?
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: short writing assignments, computer lab exercises, oral presentations, and a final research paper.

ECON 457 Public Economics Research Seminar (Not offered 2013-2014)
In this class, students will learn how to read, critically evaluate, and begin to produce empirical research on important and interesting public policy questions. Topics will be
selected from across the spectrum of public economics issues and may vary from year to year. Examples of specific topics that may be covered include education, environmental
policy, taxation, income inequality, anti-poverty policy, health care policy, the economics of crime and corruption, and the implications of behavioral economics and psychology
for public policy (we will typically only cover a subset of these topics). Applications will be drawn mostly from the United States but we will also consider some issues and
evidence from other industrialized and developing countries. The course will especially emphasize the critical analysis of empirical evidence on public policy questions.
Format: a mix of lecture, seminar discussion, and time in a computer lab learning to work with data and estimate econometric models . Requirements will include a 15- to
20-page research paper (written in stages) that is a combination of a research proposal and an original empirical analysis of data, a series of short papers and empirical exercises,
and regular constructive contributions to class discussion.

ECON 458T(S) Economics of Risk
Risk and uncertainty are pervasive features of economic decisions and outcomes. Individuals face risk about health status and future job prospects. For a firm, developing new
products is risky; furthermore, once a product has been developed, the firm faces product liability risk if it turns out to be unsafe. Investment decisions —from managing a
portfolio to starting a business—are also fraught with uncertainty. Some risks are environmental—both manmade problems and natural disasters; other risks include the possibility of terrorist attack and, more locally, issues of campus safety. This tutorial explores both the private market responses to risk (e.g., financial markets, insurance markets, private
contracting, and precautionary investments and saving) and government policies towards risk (e.g., regulation, taxation, and the legal system). From a theoretical standpoint, the
course will build on expected utility theory, diversification, options valuation, principal-agent models, contract theory, and cost-benefit analysis. We will apply these tools to a
wide variety of economic issues such as the ones listed above. One goal of the course is to discover common themes across the disparate topics. Students will be expected to read
and synthesize a variety of approaches to risk and uncertainty and apply them to various issues.
Format: tutorial; will meet with the instructor in pairs in each week. Requirements: each student will write a paper (or do a short project) every other week, and comment on his or
her partner’s work in the other weeks. The final two weeks will be reserved for applied projects of the student’s choice. One of the papers during the term will be revised to reflect
feedback from the instructor and the student’s partner.
Prerequisites: ECON 251, 252, and ECON 253 or 255. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to senior majors.

ECON 459 Economics of Institutions (Not offered 2013-2014)
Why are some countries rich and others poor? There are numerous candidate explanations emphasizing factors ranging from demography to technological innovation to unequal
international relations. However, some economists like Douglass North and Mancur Olson have argued that beneath the profusion of proximate causes the quality of a country’s
“institutions” fundamentally determines its economic prospects. The word “institutions” is used broadly; it can refer to micro-structures like households or macro-structures like
the state. The course will survey the literature on institutions and economic development, discussing both developed and developing countries. Readings will largely consist of
published journal articles and unpublished work of similar quality. Students should expect to use microeconomic theory and econometrics learned in previous courses.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on four short papers of 7-10 pages each.
Prerequisites: ECON 251, ECON 253 or 255 or the equivalent; students who have already taken ECON 502 will not be admitted. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference

ECON 460(S) Economic Development of China
This course is an introduction to the economic development of China in the post-1978 period. It seeks to provide an overview of the process by which China grew from an
economic backwater to the second largest economy in the world, with a particular focus on rural development and the growing gap between rural and urban incomes; human
capital and education; and health and gender in the Chinese context. In addition, the course has the goal of familiarizing students with current economics research on Chinese
topics and enabling them to be informed consumers of this research.

ECON 461(S) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling (Same as ECON 526)
The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is an important tool for applied policy work. CGE models are the primary tool for many government organizations when
evaluating policy alternatives and are also used extensively by various NGO’s when deciding aid and policy recommendations. The great advantage of these models is that they
capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the economy. This is of great importance to applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers from potential policies. The class will begin with a general overview of CGE models. This overview will be rigorous and mathematical. This course
will use the free programming packages GAMS and MPSGE to implement various CGE models using real world data. While no previous computer experience is required, some
familiarity with Excel is recommended. During the latter part of the course, students will create a CGE model for a country of their choice and conduct policy experiments using
their model. Interested students could continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, two midterms, final project and presentation.

ECON 463(F) Financial History (W)
This course opens with a brief survey of some of the major characteristics, issues, and challenges of financial systems today, and then examines earlier experience with these
phenomena. Topics to be examined include: the role of finance in economic development historically; the relationship between finance and government, and the extent to which
it has changed over time; the lessons from early asset bubbles for modern financial systems; the effect of institutions (laws, norms, and culture) and political systems in shaping
the impact of finance, as illustrated by comparisons between Mexico and the U.S., among other cases; and lessons from U.S. financial history for policies today. The course also
examines the tools that were developed in earlier epochs to deal with different risks, evaluates their efficacy, and considers lessons for modern financial regulation.

ECON 467T Development Successes (Same as ECON 531T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Although living standards in most of the worlds poor countries have increasingly fallen behind those of the rich industrial countries, a relatively small number of countries that
were quite poor in the middle of the last century have achieved dramatic improvements in their incomes since then. These development successes include countries such as
Japan, the four dragons (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the MIT economies (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand), the Asian giants of China and India, as well as
non-Asian economies as diverse as Botswana, Chile, and Turkey. This tutorial will explore why these countries have apparently succeeded where many other poor countries
have failed. A particular focus of the course will be on extracting insights from the experiences of these success cases about the broad development strategies that have been
advocated over the past 50 years by scholars as well as by the international financial institutions.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation; students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and deliver formal comments on five papers written by other students.

A 25 year-old man living in a high-income household can expect to live 10 years longer than his low-income counterpart. There are also stark differences in mortality and health
by education, employment status, race, immigrant status, region, and gender. This course will explore many of the potential explanations for health disparities, including access to
insurance and health care, health behaviors, stress, environmental exposure, and intergenerational transmission of health. We will emphasize causal inference and focus on
assessing the quality of evidence. We will also investigate how government policies contribute to or ameliorate health disparities in the U.S.
Format: seminar. Course will include frequent small group meetings, a computer lab, and a poverty simulation. Evaluation includes class discussion, oral presentations, 4 short
response papers, two 5-page critiques of published articles, and one 15-page original empirical research paper.

ECON 470 The Indian Economy: Development and Social Justice (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
The Indian economy today is described in two competing narratives. India is, on the one hand, a fast-growing “emerging economy:” it is producing a range of information
technology services, threatening white-collar jobs in the United States; its growing consumption of fossil fuels is stressing world energy supplies and contributing to global
warming; along with China, it is changing the balance of international economic and political relations. In another narrative Indian economic growth is lop-sided and unsustainable: poverty and malnutrition remain widespread; Maoist insurgencies threaten a swath of eastern districts; and conflicts rage over threatened ecological resources. In one
prominent academic work India has been described as an “Emerging Giant;” in another, it is a “Republic of Hunger.” This course will introduce the student to these narratives in
the words of participants, ranging from books by CEO’s of major corporations to pamphlets produced by left-wing critics of present economic policies.
We will then use the traditional theoretical and quantitative methods of an economist to evaluate these perspectives, and, consistent with the goals of the Exploring Diversity
Initiative, consider how they are shaped by power, privilege, and the social location of the narrator.
Format: seminar. Requirements: five short response papers (5 pages), and longer final paper (15 pages).

ECON 471 Topics in Advanced Econometrics (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
This course focuses on a set of topics in the fields of time series econometrics and panel time series. Particular emphasis is placed on methods of structural identification of
macroeconomic dynamics in vector autoregressive analysis and long run cointegration analysis, both in a conventional time series framework and in more recently developed
multi-country and multiregional panel time series contexts. The course is well suited for students exploring possibilities for empirically oriented honors theses in fields that
employ these techniques, such as macro, finance, growth, international trade and macro-development. It is also well suited for students who simply wish to expand their econometrics training and understanding to a more advanced level, or wish to pursue an honors thesis in econometrics. The course will cover both conceptual and practical issues.

ECON 473 Microfinance (Same as ECON 520) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q) (D)
Unequal access to finance (loans, savings, insurance) contributes to the persistence of poverty in developing countries. We review evidence that the entrepreneurial poor lack
access to loans, and discuss how repayments can be enforced even when borrowers do not have collateral. We discuss how recent innovations in micro-insurance can reduce
vulnerability. We will study the role of governments and donors in equalizing financial access through subsidies or targeting. Finally, we shall explore how microfinance can
empower women within the household. Readings include current empirical and theoretical research in development economics. This course is an EDI course because it critically
analyzes how microfinance interventions can reduce inequality both within and across households.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on a midterm, a series of short papers and a longer final paper.

ECON 504(F) Public Economics
This class is about microeconomic and empirical analysis of government expenditure programs in developing and transitional countries. It provides tools for understanding the
effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as “what role should government play in the economy” and
“what is a good policy?” The course begins by considering the efficiency of market economies, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public goods,
externalities, information-based market failures, imperfect competition, and equity. We also consider ways that human behavior might deviate from perfect rationality, and what
that might imply for policy. Along the way, we apply these concepts to various examples of policy issues, including, among other things, the environment, education, health,
infrastructure, security, social insurance, and aid to the poor. We then turn to the general question of how to make the government work better, addressing questions such as the
following. When is it better to have the government own and produce things, and when is it better to privatize? What are the incentives of politicians and government employees,
and how does the design of political and budgetary institutions affect the degree to which they serve the public interest? How should responsibilities be divided up between the
central government and local governments, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of “decentralization?” What can be done to improve the delivery of basic services?
For example, how might one address problems of corruption and absenteeism? Throughout the course, we consider examples of empirical research, and to facilitate this, we will
occasionally introduce econometric tools that are particularly useful for microeconomic policy evaluation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, one 10-page paper, midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: ECON 110; in addition, an empirical methods course (ECON 253, 255, 502 or 503, or STAT 346) must be taken before or concurrently with this class; undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor’s permission. Students who have previously taken Econ 205 will not be enrolled. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor’s permission.

ECON 505(F) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in developing countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic
stability and long-run growth, the rest of the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical model that is suitable for analyzing a
wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries. This model provides the general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies in the two
remaining parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the requirements of fiscal solvency and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It will also examine alternative methods for achieving fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal institutions. The final part of the course will turn to an
analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank independence, time consistency of monetary policy, and the design of monetary policy rules in small open economies.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two hour tests and a comprehensive final exam.
Prerequisites: ECON 251 and 252. Expected enrollment: 25-30. Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor’s permission.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 MWF

ECON 506 Fundamentals of Developing Country Macroeconomics (Not offered 2013-2014)
This class covers the basic principles of macroeconomics, with an emphasis on the issues facing for developing, transition, and emerging market economies. The course begins
with an introduction to core macro concepts and definitions. It then looks at the sectors and institutions that play major roles in the economy: households, businesses, the external
sector, the fiscal authority, and the central bank. It goes on to develop a simple analytical framework for thinking about economic performance and policies. The course concludes
with a discussion of some of the macroeconomic problems encountered in developing economies, and some of the policies that can be used to deal with them. The class is offered
as an alternative to Econ 505 for those not intending to specialize in macroeconomics. Consequently, it does not qualify as a prerequisite for Econ 515.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two hour tests and a comprehensive final exam.
No prerequisites.; enrollment limited to CDE students. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option.

ECON 510(S) Finance and Development
This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores the functions of finance, how it contributes to growth, and reviews
different models of financial sector development and their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with financial sector repression and
subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial crises. Then it will study how to make finance effective and how to prevent or minimize crises,
analyzing government’s role as regulator, supervisor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part, attention will be devoted to the role of institutions (laws,
norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector development.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm, group presentation, short critique, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: ECON 251 and 252. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor’s permission.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF

CAPRIO

ECON 511 Institutions and Governance (Not offered 2013-2014)
Over the last two decades economists have become increasingly aware of the importance of the “social infrastructure” at various levels of economic activity: capable and honest
government officials must be available to formulate and implement policies, markets must be supported by suitable institutional frameworks, property rights must be secure, and
contracts reliably enforced. Even the structure of the household, the smallest institution analyzed by economists, has been shown to have an important influence on economic
development. This course will survey the growing literature on institutions and governance.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on several short assignments, and a longer final paper.
Prerequisites: at least one among ECON 253, ECON 255, ECON 502, ECON 503, STAT 346; requires permission of instructor; students who have previously taken ECON 459
will not be enrolled. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

ECON 513(S) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved specialized empirical techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are
designed to meet the practical challenges that the data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the theory and application of these techniques,
and students will learn how to implement these techniques using real world data to address practical questions drawn from the fields of macro, international finance and development. Topics to which these techniques will be applied include business cycle analysis and forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and determinants of long run economic
growth. Computer work and programming will be an important and integral part of the course, but no previous training is expected. Economics majors who are considering
writing an honors thesis on related topics are encouraged to enroll in this course during the spring semester of their junior year. Students studying abroad during their junior year
may nonetheless take this course during their senior year.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short empirical projects, midterm, term paper.
Prerequisites: ECON 252, ECON 255 or equivalent, and ECON 393 (360 may substitute for 393). Not open to students who have taken ECON 471. Enrollment limit: 19
(expected: 19). Preference will be given to senior Economics majors and CDE fellows.

ECON 514(S) Tax Policy in Emerging Markets (Q)
Taxes are half of what government does. So if you are interested in what government policy can do to promote efficiency, equity, and economic development, you should be
interested in tax policy. Governments must raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods, address other market failures and distributional issues, and to avoid problems with
debt and inflation. Taxes typically take up anywhere from ten to fifty percent of a country’s income, they profoundly affect the incentives to undertake all varieties of economic
activity, and the government expenditures that they finance have potentially large consequences for human welfare. So the stakes involved in improving tax policy are quite large.
All of these issues are of great importance in developing and transitional countries (also known as “emerging markets”), but in these nations taxation is especially challenging
because of serious problems with tax evasion and administration, among other things. This class provides an in-depth exploration of tax policy, with an emphasis on the challenges and issues most relevant in emerging markets. Topics addressed in this class include: how basic economic principles can be applied to help one think about the efficiency
and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the
economy; ideas for fundamental reforms of these taxes; theory and evidence in the debate over progressive taxes versus “flat” taxes; how various elements of tax design affect
incentives to save and invest; how market failures may influence the optimality of different tax policies; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for
the design of tax policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on economic growth, foreign direct investment,
labor supply, and tax evasion; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; presumptive taxation; the
“unofficial” economy and its implications for tax policy; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; taxes on imports and exports; non-tax methods of raising
revenue; and political economy considerations in tax policy.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm exam, problem sets, two short essays and a final 10- to 15-page research paper.
Prerequisites: one public economics course or microeconomics course (ECON 504 or ECON 110), and one empirical methods course (POEC 253, ECON 255, 502, or 503);
students who have previously taken ECON 351 will not be enrolled.) Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Preference given to CDE students, but undergraduates with the
prerequisites are welcome.

ECON 515(S) Developing Country Macroeconomics II
This lecture course is a continuation of Economics 505. The first part of the course extends the analysis of the first semester to several open-economy issues that arise in developing countries, especially with respect to the interactions among exchange rate regimes, monetary policy regimes, and policies directed at the financial account of the balance of
payments. The second part of the course will apply these analytical tools, as well as those developed in Economics 505, to an examination of the various types of crises that have
afflicted developing countries over the past three decades, considering in particular the implications of such crises for growth and development.

Why isn’t the whole world developed? This course (and instructor) is of the opinion that the difficulty of getting incentives right is the key source of inefficiency. The course
therefore studies how limited enforcement and asymmetric information constrain development, and about innovative development designs that attempt to overcome these
constraints. The course readings will be a mix of field studies, empirical evidence and theoretical tools from game theory. Incentive and corruption problems in health, education,
the regulation of banks and natural monopolies, privatization, budgeting, debt forgiveness, foreign aid, microfinance, climate treaties and ethnic violence will be studied using a
unified framework.

ECON 532T(S) Inclusive Growth: The Role of Social Safety Nets
Designing and implementing effective national strategies to promote inclusive economic growth can require difficult policy reforms, sometimes with adverse short-term impacts
for vulnerable groups within society. Social safety nets provide a pro-poor policy instrument that can balance trade and labor market reform, fiscal adjustments (such as reduced
general subsidies) and other economic policies aimed at enabling better market performance. In addition, social safety nets help the poor to cope with shocks to their livelihoods,
promoting resilience, human capital development and sometimes high-return risk-taking. This tutorial will offer students the opportunity to explore the role of social safety nets in
promoting inclusive economic growth, drawing on case studies from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The first part of the tutorial will define social safety nets
within the broader context of social protection, examining the diversity of instruments and their linkages to economic growth. The second part will delve more deeply into the
design and implementation of effective interventions, assessing program choice, affordability, targeting, incentives and other issues. The third part will analyze the role of social
safety nets in supporting economic growth strategies, drawing on international lessons of experience.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation: students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and deliver formal comments on five papers written by other students.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

The study of English allows students to explore the critical role language and literature play in the shaping of human culture and social experience. Department courses
cover a variety of national, regional, and diasporic literary traditions; acquaint students with a range of genres and cultural practices, including poetry, prose, drama, film, and
mixed or emerging media; and employ a range of critical and methodological approaches. All foster skills of critical analysis, interpretation, and written argument and expression. By cultivating a sophisticated awareness of linguistic and literary representation, and by encouraging the ability to read critically and write persuasively, the English major
provides students with intellectual and analytical skills that they can draw upon to follow a wide range of paths.
COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which focus on interpretive skills as well as skills in writing and argumentation. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course is required
for admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced
Placement examination in English Literature or of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors
and count as major courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses are designed for first- and
second-year students who are considering becoming English majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department. All Gateway courses are
writing-intensive. First-year students who have placed out of the 100-level courses are encouraged to take a Gateway course as their introduction to the department.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are designed primarily for students who have some experience with textual analysis, and are open to sophomores, juniors, and
seniors. First-year students who wish to enroll in a 300-level course are advised to consult the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who have completed at least one 300-level
English course; they should be attractive to any student interested in a course that emphasizes student initiated independent work. Majors considering Honors work and who
wish to prepare for it are urged to take a 400-level course before senior year.
ADVISING
All students who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or the department chair.
Prospective majors are particularly encouraged to discuss their interest with faculty as early as possible. In the spring of the sophomore year, newly declared majors must
meet with a faculty member to discuss the Major Plan. Declared majors will be assigned a permanent advisor shortly after they declare the major.

131

MAJOR
1) Major Plan. Shortly after declaring the major, all English majors must complete a short written plan for how they intend to complete the major. In this plan, students
should consider how they can most fruitfully explore the broad range of genres, historical periods, and national and cultural traditions that literature in English encompasses, and how they wish to focus upon a particular intellectual interest within English. Students are encouraged to begin discussing the Major Plan with a faculty
member as soon as they become interested in the major; junior majors must meet with faculty advisors to revisit Major Plans as they register for courses. There will
also be informational meetings and web resources available to assist new majors in developing the Major Plan.
Students majoring in English must take at least nine courses, including the following:
2) Any 100-level English class. Students exempted by the department from 100-level courses will substitute an elective course.
3) At least one 200-level Gateway course (grouped at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students
contemplating the major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing students to
critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Literary Histories or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
4) At least one Criticism course (identified in parentheses at the end of the course description). A course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular method, theorist,
or critic in depth. (Please note that when a Criticism course is also listed as satisfying the Literary Histories requirement, the course may be used to satisfy either requirement, but not both.)
5) At least three courses at the 300-level or above.
6) At least three courses designated as Literary Histories. Literary Histories courses concern the emergence or development of a specific literary tradition or problem
and/or its transformation across multiple historical periods. Literary Histories are identified by LH-A, LH-B, or LH-C in parentheses at the end of the course description.
LH-A: courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1800.
LH-B: courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1900 but not included in LH-A (courses on literature from 1800-1900 and some surveys).
LH-C: courses dealing primarily with literature written after 1900.
Of the three Literary Histories courses required for the major, at least two must focus on literature before 1900 (LH-A or LH-B), with at least one of these focusing
primarily on literature before 1800 (LH-A).
For further clarification, please see the English Department webpage at http://web.williams.edu/English/.
Courses outside the department
The department will give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in literature of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original
language or in translation. Such a course may not be used to satisfy the department’s Literary Histories, Criticism, or Gateway requirements.

STUDY AWAY
Majors who plan to study abroad should be proactive in understanding how this will affect their plans for completing major requirements. Such plans should be discussed in
advance with the student’s advisor as well as the department’s administrative assistant. Approval of departmental credit for courses taken off-campus must be obtained in
advance from the department chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical thesis, and a critical specialization. Candidates for the program should have at
least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the director of honors
(Gage McWeeny) by April of the junior year.
All routes require students to take a minimum of ten regular-semester courses (rather than the nine otherwise required for the major). Students doing a creative writing thesis
must, by graduation, take at least nine regular semester courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Thesis) and English W31 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior
year. Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and, in addition, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors Colloquium and spring Honors Thesis) and English W31 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year. Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least
eight regular-semester courses, and in addition, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors Colloquium and spring Honors Thesis) and English W30 (Senior Thesis: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.

Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis is a significant body of fiction or poetry completed during the fall semester and winter study of the senior year, and usually including revised writing
done in earlier semesters. (With permission of the honors committee, the thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.)
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced workshop (or, in exceptional cases, not including poetry or fiction, a substantial body
of work in place of an advanced workshop), a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), and the approval of the departmental honors committee. A creative thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of winter study; one begun in winter study is due the third Monday after spring break. The methods
of evaluation are identical to those for critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).

Critical Thesis
The critical thesis is a substantial critical essay written during both semesters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. It must consider critical and/or theoretical as
well as literary texts. The thesis is normally about 15,000 words (45 pages); in no case should it be longer than 25,000 words (75 pages). The proposal, a 3-page description of the
thesis project, should indicate the subject to be investigated and the arguments to be considered, along with a bibliography. The finished thesis is due on the third Monday
following spring break. After the critical thesis has been completed, the student publicly presents his or her work.

Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is a series of forays into a broad area of interest related to work undertaken in at least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the
English Department, and both need to have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The specialization route entails: (1) a set of three 10-page essays which together
advance a flexibly related set of arguments; (2) an annotated bibliography (5 pages) of secondary sources, explaining their importance to the area of specialization; (3) a meeting
with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliography; (4) a fourth essay
of 12 pages, considering matters that arose during the faculty-student meeting and reflecting on the outcome of the specialization. The 3-page proposal for the specialization
should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the methods to be used for their investigation. It should also describe the relation between
previous course work and the specialization, and include a brief bibliography of secondary works. The first two papers are due by the end of fall semester; the third paper is due at
the end of winter study; the bibliography is due mid-February; and the final paper is due the third Monday after spring break.

Applying to the Honors Program
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty advisor and the director of honors before April of the junior year. Prior
to preregistration in April, candidates for critical theses and specializations submit a 3-page proposal that includes an account of the proposed project and a bibliography. Students
applying to creative writing honors submit a brief proposal describing the project they wish to pursue. Decisions regarding admission to the honors program will be made by the
end of May. Admission to the honors program depends on the department’s assessment of the qualifications of the student, the feasibility of the project, and the availability of an
appropriate advisor.
When pre-registering for Fall 2013, students who are applying to critical honors should register for the Honors Colloquium as one of their four courses.

Progress and Evaluation of Honors
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review process are completed, students must do satisfactory work to continue in
the program. Should the student’s work in the fall semester not meet this standard, the course will convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will
register for a regular winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study (English W30 or W31) to enroll in English
494 in the spring semester. When such is not the case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study “99.”

Students are required to submit one electronic copy to the department Academic Assistant at pmalanga@williams.edu. Students should also give a final hard copy to their
thesis advisor. Both the electronic copy and the hard copy are due on the dates applicable to the type of project pursued (see the above descriptions of each type of project for the
due dates). All honors projects are evaluated by the advisor and two other faculty members. The advisor determines the student’s semester grades in honors, while the two
external readers recommend to the department that the project receive Highest Honors, Honors, or no Honors. Honors of any kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of
courses in the major during the senior year. Highest Honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the
major has been exceptional.

COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which focus on interpretive skills—techniques of reading—
as well as skills in writing and argumentation. English 150 and 152 will focus more directly on basic expository writing skills than the other 100-level
classes. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A
100-level course is required for admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of the introductory
courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English Literature or a 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
ENGL 107(F) Science-Fiction of the African Diaspora (Same as AFR 107 and AMST 106) (W) (D)
Publishers, authors, academics, and critics often assume that science fiction and fantasy readers are all or mostly white, an assumption driven, perhaps, by the scarcity of black
writers inside the genre—the science-fiction creative-writing classes I teach at Williams, for example, are depressingly undiverse. And for a long time, among professional
science-fiction writers, Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler represented pretty much the entire deal.
The last fifteen years, however, have witnessed the emergence of a number of black science fiction and fantasy authors from the Americas and Africa. In this course we will read
a sample of this fiction, paying particular attention to these questions: In what new ways (if any) do these authors gesture toward themes of social hierarchy or race? In what ways
(if any) do the standard science-fiction ropes of imagined futures, interplanetary colonization, or contact with alien life allow black writers a new metaphorical vocabulary to talk
about their own experience? In what ways (if any) are they constrained by readers’ expectations, while white writers are not?
This is a discussion-based class. Assignments will include original creative writing, imitative or parodic writing, and of course that old stand-by, interpretive essays on assigned
texts. We will be reading well-thumbed classics by Charles Chesnutt, Paulina Hopkins, Amos Tutuola, W.E.B. DuBois, Delany, and Butler, but also newer works by Derrick
Bell, Nalo Hopkinson, Anthony Joseph, Tananarive Due, Akua Lezli Hope, Nisi Shawl, Ama Patterson, Kuni Ibura Salaam, and Nnedi Okorafor, among others.
This course fulfills the EDI requirement, as it engages questions of power and privilege, and the coded representation of racial or ethnic otherness. Any story that involves the
clash of sentient species, for example, or a nostalgic or disruptive reinterpretation of the social hierarchies of the past, partakes implicitly of this coded language.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on substantial, weekly writing assignments of graduated length totaling 20 pages over the course of the semester and active participation in classroom discussion.

ENGL 109(F) Complaints, Rants, and Grievances (W) (D)
We interpret some emotions, like love and happiness, as individually and socially “good.” But how did these feelings come to be the good ones? If some feelings are “bad,” then
what makes them so? As philosopher Sara Ahmed notes,“If good emotions are cultivated, and are worked on and towards, then they remain defined against uncultivated or
unruly emotions.” This class will embrace ”unruly” emotions—rage, despair, irritation, apathy—in order to investigate the literary, social, and political potential of “bad feelings.” Examining literary forms of protest and figures of dissatisfaction and dissent, we will ask: Are emotions political? Can literary expressions of emotion reinforce or challenge social hierarchies? (More broadly, can literature in general germinate social change?) How do some literary forms disrupt our assumptions about emotion and character? In
what ways do social categories like race and gender affect representations of emotion? In what ways could “irrational” feelings operate as forms of reason or knowledge? We will
read works by Virginia Woolf, Nella Larsen, Herman Melville, Langston Hughes, Jamaica Kincaid, and Valerie Solanas with an eye to the ways these texts rail against, resonate
with, transform, or do nothing at all to their literary, political, and social contexts.
As part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, this class examines how philosophies of emotion have helped to create and consolidate social privilege, and, through analysis of
literary forms and representations of protest, encourages critical theorization of social conflict and dissent.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation; 4 or 5 essays totaling 20 pages of writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students who have not taken or placed out of a 100-level English course.

COWDEN
ENGL 112(F) Introduction to Literary Criticism (W)
What determines meaning? How we interpret is inevitably inflected by our own preoccupations, by the contexts in which we read, by the literary and other conventions influencing a work and by the historical and personal circumstances of its composition, as well as deriving from the particular words of a text and from the mutable life of language itself.
So how to go about the task of reading literature well, and reading critically? This course will focus on key introductory methods and critical approaches, and is intended both to
develop your skills in reading, writing about, discussing and interpreting literary texts. Our readings-mainly short fiction and poetry, along with selected introductory work in
critical theory-will invite increased self-consciousness about literary form, the functions of criticism, and the process of reading and interpretation. In the last weeks of the course,
we will read longer texts, including at least one play and one novel.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three formal essays, from 3-page minimum to 5-page minimum, and four reading-response papers with 2-page minimum; plus one required
revision; active participation in class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first-year students who have not taken or placed out of a 100-level English course.

ENGL 115(F) Rumble in the Jungle: Major Postcolonial Writers and Movements (Same as COMP 115) (W) (D)
The antagonism between the “West and the rest” has been a defining feature of modern history, especially during the struggles of the colonies to establish themselves as independent nations at the turn of the twentieth century. While armies and politicians were busy using the blunt tools of violence and political rabble-rousing to advance one side or
another, many artists and writers challenged the simplistic oppositions that made cultures out to be at odds with one another by giving voice to complex identities and histories.
An Irishman channels the ghost of a kidnapped Renaissance geographer from Africa; a Bangladeshi woman dreams the arrival of a Pterodactyl in modern-day India; amateur
Algerian actors star in one of the century’s most well regarded films depicting the fall of French colonialism—our works will take us around the world, and stretch us across
multiple histories of colonialism and its aftermaths. We will watch narrative and documentary cinema, look at visual art, and read poetry, fiction, essays, and philosophy, and
consider how these media and genres work as forms of thoughtful resistance as well as creative expression. Key authors will include W.B. Yeats, Franz Fanon, Aimé Césaire,
V.S. Naipaul, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and Mahasweta Devi. In asking students to think broadly and comparatively about discourses of otherness and their impact on artistic, philosophical, and other cultural production, this course will contribute to the college’s Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, presentation, four short position papers (3 pp, with one revision), and a longer project (6-8 pp) on one of the course’s core
authors.

KOLB

ENGL 116(F) The Ethics of Fiction (W)
Can made up stories actually be bad for you? (Plato seems to have thought so.) Conversely, can they do you any good, even transform your vision of what it means to be good?
Can reading fiction, that is, shape your moral character? Or is literature really just entertainment, however sophisticated and intellectually challenging? In this course, we will
explore questions like these about the ethics of fiction, questions that have inspired some practitioners of the art to make claims such as: “Surely one of the novel’s habitual aims is
to articulate morality, to sharpen the reader’s sense of vice and virtue” (John Updike); “You write in order to change the world...and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way a
person looks at reality, then you can change it” (James Baldwin); “...a writer [is] as an architect of the soul” (Doris Lessing); “Naturally you’re aware that bad art can finally
cripple a man” (Saul Bellow). If you are curious about the subject of ethics, enjoy reading narrative fictions, and are interested in thinking about the connection between the two,
this may be the class for you. We will read a varied selection of fiction along with a fair amount of scholarship on the links between moral philosophy and narrative forms in order
to refine the critical language we have at our disposal. Writers we will read include: Elizabeth Anscombe, J.M. Coetzee, Cora Diamond, Richard Eldridge, Kazuo Ishiguro,
Henry James, Immanuel Kant, Toni Morrison, Iris Murdoch, Tim O’Brien, Robert Pippin, and Jean-Paul Sartre.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and five papers totaling 20 pages.

ENGL 117(F) Introduction to Cultural Theory (Same as COMP 117) (W)
This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you were about to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you
were registered for a course on the American Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and southern states in the 1860s. But if you
decide you want to study “culture,” what exactly is it that you are studying? The aim of this course is not to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but to
show you why it is so hard to come up with such definitions. People fight about what the word “culture” means, and our main business will be to get an overview of that
conceptual brawl. We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and
those thinkers who see culture as a special form of bondage, a prison without walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by authors ranging from
Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to put our new ideas to the test, watch several films (Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of
the Rings) and listen to a lot of rock & roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there’s no turning back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students who have not taken or placed out of a 100-level English course.

THORNE

ENGL 119(S) Missed Encounters (W) (D)
Although we attempt to engage directly those who are personally and culturally alien, such exchanges remain inseparable from our fantasies of otherness. Those fantasies can be
as reductive as a stereotype, but they can also be enormously nuanced and self-revealing, as rich as literature itself. We will study the missed encounter—the encounter in which
the element of presupposition and fantasy is vividly apparent—in cultural contexts from the first English accounts of the inhabitants of Virginia to race relations in contemporary
African fiction; we will consider such encounters in other contexts as well, including sexual relations, the relations between young and old, even the relation between past and
present. But in every case, we will look with an eye toward what such events tell us about the nature of fantasy. The course will consider novels, drama, film, opera, and non-fiction works, perhaps including: Coetzee, Waiting for the Barbarians; Harriot, “Report of the New Found Land of Virginia”; Conrad, Heart of Darkness; Naipaul, Bend in the
River; Crane, “The Blue Hotel”; Gordimer, The Pick Up; Herzog, Aguirre; Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet or Othello; Puccini, Madame Butterfly; Huang, M. Butterfly and
Austen, Pride and Prejudice. The course reflects the aims of the Diversity Initiative insofar as it encourages self-consciousness about cultural difference and the role of representation in cultural knowledge.

NEWMAN

ENGL 125(F) Theater and Politics (W)
When Plato designed his ideal republic, he excluded theater from it, arguing that indulging in the charms of theatrical representation would make men poor governors of themselves and thus threaten the integrity of fledgling Greek democracies. In the twentieth-century, however, the work of younger artists and playwrights as diverse as Bertolt Brecht
and Antonin Artaud provocatively suggested that theater itself could remedy the ills that Plato thought it aggravated by restoring to the people the productive power that the
passively on-looking masses had ceded to the charisma of dictators. Today, as rapid changes in media daily transform the way in which we experience the world and understand
our place within it, artists, critics, and philosophers continue to draw on the terms of historical debates about theater in attempts to understand the political significance of technologically enhanced forms of global spectatorship, asking what becomes of the traditional roles of viewers and directors on the new world-stage, in an age when revolutions are
triggered by cell phone images, but advertising campaigns are also customized to consumers based on automated scans of private information like email. In this seminar, students
take a historical approach to these urgent contemporary questions, analyzing the politics of theater in literature, criticism, film, and philosophy from antiquity to the present. In
addition to excerpts from the authors already mentioned, readings may include works by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, Beckett, Jacques Rancière, and Michael
Haneke.
Format: seminar. Requirements: 4-5 papers totaling 20 pages.

JOHNSTON

ENGL 129(S) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (Same as AFR 129) (W)
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African American poets have been preoccupied with the relations of poetry to other
traditions. Vernacular speech, English poetry, jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all been seen as essential sources for black poetry. This
course will survey major poets such as Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Baraka, Jackson, and Yusef Komunyakaa, reading their poems and their essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will ask how black poetry has been defined and whether there is a single black poetic tradition or several.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers totaling at least 20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students who have not taken or placed out of a 100-level English course.

D. L. SMITH

ENGL 130(F) Dream Work (W)
Sigmund Freud, whose 1900 publication of The Interpretation of Dreams profoundly influenced the 20th century’s understanding of the unconscious, described dream as a
“rebus” or “pictographic script,” the parts of which had to be read “according to their symbolic relation”; “[a]t bottom,” he insisted, “dreams are nothing other than a particular
form of thinking.” Like all art, dreams both require and resist interpretation. This class will ask whether dreams are themselves representable, and what different media uncover
and conceal about the dream’s form of thinking. We will consider a range of texts, including ancient oneirocritica, medieval dream visions, and psychoanalytic case studies,
before moving on to modern and contemporary attempts to capture the “underside of consciousness” that dream represents. Our primary texts will include fiction (Kafka, Borges,
Marilynne Robinson, Yoko Tawada), poetry (Whitman, Michael Palmer, Anne Carson, Saskia Hamilton), and film (Hitchcock, Lynch, Linklater).
Format: seminar. Requirements: four short papers for this course, totaling around 20 pages, in addition to frequent reading responses.

FISHER

ENGL 141(S) Style (W)
In their classic writing guide, Elements of Style, Strunk and White demonstrate style by quoting two different descriptions of languor, one from Hemingway, one from Faulkner.
This class will continue that experiment. We’ll read a range of authors working in a mix of genres (poetry by Dickinson and Whitman, stories by James and Poe, and of course
novels by Hemingway and Faulkner), and also consider popular music and film. We’ll pit one artist against the other on the same subject as a way of trying to isolate the
difference that style makes. What makes a style distinct? How do we know it when we see it? Can it be distilled to a formula, or is it the indissoluble expression of genius? We’ll
ask whether it makes sense to talk about a scale of style-not just better or worse, but more or less (reading Susan Sontag for guidance). And we’ll tackle the challenge of trying to
write about it. Students will turn to reviewers, both contemporary and late-great (critics like Pauline Kael and Lester Bangs), for inspiration, and learn to articulate the je ne sais
quoi of what they deem great style.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and at least 20 pages of writing divided across 4 essays.

BARNES

ENGL 144(S) Race and American Crime Fiction (Same as AMST 144) (W)
This class explores the relationship between race and mystery/crime fictions. From the emergence of the hard–boiled in the 1920s to contemporary police procedurals and spy
novels, American crime fictions have often served as vehicles for social commentary and critique. For many writers of color, such as Chester Himes, Barbara Neely, Manuel
Ramos, Ed Lin and others, the genre has also served as vehicles to explore racism and racial hierarchies, racialization of criminality and justice, and histories and experience of
violence in various minority communities. We will also consider the ways in which form and conventions of crime fiction lend themselves to articulations of race/racialization,
as well as social, cultural, historical, political concerns of different racial and ethnic groups in America. As the semester progresses, the question of what does or does not
constitute a mystery novel will become less central as we investigate multiple ways in which the texts stretch, disrupt, and play with the conventions of crime fictions.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active in-class participation (including group led discussion facilitation), 4 response papers (3-4 pages each at least one of which will
go through the process of revision), and a final paper (6-8 pages, which will also go through the process of revision and in-class workshop) on a mystery novel or film of your
choice.

ENGL 152(S) Other People’s Lives: Contemporary American Memoir (W)
The goal of this course is to teach you how to write a clear, well-argued, intelligible and interesting analytical paper. We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a
variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and a central
purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing, this is a literature class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department, so we
will, therefore, spend equal time on the interpretation of literature, in this case, contemporary American memoir, examining the ways in which recent American memoirists
represent themselves through prose and the choices they make in shaping their life stories. Given the techniques shared by novelists and memoirists, how firm is the line between
fiction and non-fiction? What are the sources of a memoirist’s authority? What are the ethics of memoir-writing? What kind of relationships do memoirists seek with their
readers, and how do they go about achieving them?
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short essays totaling twenty pages, with drafts and revisions, in-class presentations, written comments on published and student work,
active participation in discussions.

From the Golem of Prague to Wall-E, puppets, robots, and dolls show up in a huge variety of film, fiction, and art. Uncanny Valley will explore the complicated reactions that
these simulacra inspire. Why this fascination with the lifelike? What can we learn from Pinocchio, the Velveteen Rabbit or John Malkovich that we can’t learn from our interactions with real humans? Works studied will include fiction by Poe, Kafka, Capek, and A. M. Homes, as well as films by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and Tim Burton.

ROSENHEIM
ENGL 164(F) African American Literary Culture since the 1960s (Same as AMST 164 and AFR 163) (W)
Is history a burden or a treasure-house, a wardrobe or a solemn duty? For African American writers and artists living and working in the long disquiet from the decline of black
power movements to the rise of Barack Obama, history was always a problem. It was too close or too far away, overpowering or feeble, suffocating or strangely distant, and the
desire to mark off this anxiety produced a series of “posts” that no one ever entirely believed in: “post-racial” (no), “post-black” (jk), “post-civil rights” (in all the wrong ways),
“post-soul” (well, maybe). Drawing on visual art and independent film as well as poetry, prose, and drama, this course will examine a range of responses to history’s burden, its
weight or its lightness, by figures such as Henry Dumas, Toni Morrison, August Wilson, Julie Dash, Harryette Mullen, Colson Whitehead, Kevin Young, Evie Shockley, and
Edward P. Jones. Because this course is writing-intensive, we’ll spend significant time developing writing skills, with an emphasis on collaborative learning.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, regular short writing assignments, and four to five papers totaling about 20 pages.

ENGL 205(F) The Art of Poetry (W)
”If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off,” Emily Dickinson wrote, “I know that is poetry.” This course will explore the particular pleasures and excitements of
poetry, taking up a wide range of poets-John Donne, Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Robert Hayden, e.e.cummings, Louise Glück, William Butler Yeats, Stephen Dunn, Richard
Wilbur, Mary Oliver, and many others. We will raise such questions as, How exactly is poetry different from prose? Can we ever determine the “true” meaning of any poem? Can
we reasonably argue that some poems are good and some are bad? How is our reading of a poem affected by what we know about the author, or the historical moment when the
poem was composed, or the shape of the book in which it first appeared? What, finally, can a poem do to us?

ENGL 220(F) Introduction to African American Writing (Same as AMST 220 and AFR 220)
Toni Morrison has described her writing as guided by a musician’s imperative always to hold something in reserve, to leave her audience wanting something more. It’s a simple
idea, but a strange one—that a reader’s desire might be fulfilled only by its increase, that its satisfaction requires that it is never enough. African American writing, in all its
richness and variety, moves between never enough and something more; this course will introduce just a few of the historical experiences, intellectual currents, cultural resources,
thematic preoccupations, and formal strategies encountered in this writing, and consider how and to what ends African American literary tradition(s) have been organized, in
critical and polemical ways, by individual writers and scholars, and by artistic and political movements. We’ll forego the perspective of a grand overview, diving right in instead,
and we won’t necessarily always reach for the best-known titles by the most famous authors. In any case, by the end of the course, you should be prepared to have more left to
read than you did at the beginning.

American fiction took a turn at World War II: the simplest way to name the turn is from modernism to postmodernism. The most obvious mark of postmodern narration is its
self-consciousness; postmodern books tend to be about themselves, even when they are most historical or realistic. Already a paradox emerges: why would World War II make
narratives more self-reflexive? The first book in the course, and the best for approaching this paradox, is Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. Subsequent books: Nabokov’s Pale Fire,
Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49, Morrison’s Beloved, DeLillo’s White Noise, Carver’s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Johnson’s Jesus’s Son.

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level “Gateway” courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the
department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove fruitful in later
courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement. Students contemplating the English
major are strongly urged to take a Gateway course by the end of Sophomore year.)
ENGL 206(S) We Aren’t the World: Global Anglophone Literature in the 20th Century (W) (D) (Gateway)
An eighteenth-century diplomat once referred to the British colonies as a “vast empire on which the sun never set,” and at the time, he was right: the British controlled an
enormous portion of the globe for nearly three centuries, from the Caribbean to South Asia, from Oceania to Africa. One outcome of this vast empire was the creation of a rich
and diverse literary tradition in the English language-now called Anglophone literature-from far-flung places around the globe. This course will introduce students to select works

136

of global Anglophone literature in the twentieth century, and consider the ways in which writers from around the world have used a variety of literary forms, such as the bildungsroman, national allegory, and testimony, to participate in and reshape conversations about culture, globalization, aesthetics, and politics. Readings will include novels, poetry,
short stories, and film by writers including Joyce, Kincaid, Achebe, Rushdie, Conrad, Coetzee, and Roy, among others. The course will expose students to a variety of global
English idioms, as well as literary traditions from, or in conversation with, non–Western countries, and will participate in the College’s Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Class participation and three papers totaling 20 pages.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 209(F) Theories of Language and Literature (W) (Gateway)
This course is made up of questions: What is literature and why would anyone want to study it? What can you figure out by examining language that you can’t figure out by
studying history or psychology? Do students of literature have distinctive ways of asking questions about the world? Why do we call some language literary? Can any language
be literary if it appears in the right kind of book? Is there a difference between verbal forms of art and visual or auditory ones? Can novels do things that plays and poetry cannot?
Why does anyone read poetry anyway?
Format: seminar. Requirements: four short papers totaling 20 pages, informal weekly writing, class attendance and participation.

ENGL 210(S) Sound and Sight in Black Writing (Same as AFR 209 and AMST 204) (W) (Gateway)
From W.E.B. Du Bois to Ishmael Reed and Toni Morrison, from Sterling Brown and Zora Neale Hurston to Henry Louis Gates, writers and scholars of African American culture
have long insisted on the centrality of music and oral performance to black aesthetics. At the same time, as theorists like Brent Hayes Edwards have demonstrated, those same
aural traditions have themselves been reshaped and reorganized by conceptions of literature and technologies of printing and recording. Meanwhile, black cultural traditions have
been enriched by a running dialogue between writers like Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison and August Wilson and visual artists like Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden and Roy
DeCarava, whose urgency can be partly explained by racism’s mystifying reliance on the evidence of things seen. In this course, we will approach black writing as an interdisciplinary enterprise crossing multiple media, leaning toward what Fred Moten calls “the ensemble of the senses.” Readings may include Nathaniel Mackey, Gayl Jones, Greg Tate,
Nella Larsen, James Baldwin, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation and four or five short essays, totaling about 20-25 pages.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 221(F) Reading the Signs (W) (Gateway)
How have American authors imagined the activity of interpretation? What counts as a sign, and how do you know if you’re reading it accurately? This course will consider a
wide range of texts that make scrutiny their central action: Jonathan Edwards and Thoreau reading the landscape for signs of cosmic meaning; Poe and Henry James piling up
clues and feints in their detective and ghost stories; Faulkner setting up the impossible task of piecing together a history in Absalom, Absalom!; Pynchon detailing the paranoiac
quest to find hidden order in The Crying of Lot 49. These texts about interpretation have, in turn, spurred literary scholars to their own interpretive efforts. So as we track the forms
that American literature has given to the search for meaning, we’ll also walk through a range of literary-critical approaches to decoding, unpacking, and otherwise making
meaning from that literature.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation and about 20 pages of writing divided across 3 or 4 essays.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19(expected: 19). Preference given to first years and sophomores considering the major.

ENGL 222 Lyric Poetry (W) (Gateway) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The goal of this writing–intensive gateway course is to advance our abilities as rigorous, subtle, and imaginative interpreters of poetry. Our focus will be on lyrics— relatively
short poems in which a single speaker describes (often in intense language) his or her emotions, attitudes, or state of mind. Our readings will be drawn from a range of historical
periods from the seventeenth century forward, with particular emphasis on poems written since the mid–nineteenth century. Among the poets likely to be studied are: Jonson,
Gray, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Dickinson, Hardy, Owen, Yeats, Auden, Frost, and Heaney. We will also discuss works by two poets at Williams: Lawrence Raab and
Jessica Fisher.
Format: seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing, in four or five short essays; class participation.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 225(S) Romanticism and Modernism (W) (Gateway)
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, literature written in English participated in two international aesthetic movements, Romanticism and Modernism, respectively. While
Modernism is often thought to mark a decisive break with Romanticism—in part because both movements presented themselves as “new,” a radical departure from what had
gone before—there are important continuities and affinities as well as breaches between the two movements. This course will investigate the nature of Romanticism and Modernism, and the relation between them. We will study major works from each period, including polemics, poetry, novels, and short stories. Our Romantic writers will be primarily
British, and will include Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelley; Modernist writers will include a more international cast of characters: Wilde, the French Symbolist
poets, along with Pound, Stein, Williams, and several Harlem Renaissance writers. We will explore each movement’s engagement with a range of topics and issues: for example,
the subjective experience of time and memory; the nature of symbolization and the role of “feeling” in art; the relation of the individual mind to social life; the conflicted appeal
for the artist of “common” language and experience, on the one hand, and avant-garde forms of expression, on the other. Our broader aim will be to invite potential English
majors to think critically about the principles that underlie the ordering of literary history into aesthetic movements and “periods.”
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion; four or five short essays, including at least one revision totaling about 20 pages.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 230(F) Introduction to Literary Theory (Same as COMP 240) (Gateway) (W)
This course introduces students to some of the most significant and compelling trends in modern criticism-such as gender theory, deconstruction, new historicism, and psychoanalytic criticism—in an applied, hands-on way. The course will consider a few primary texts from different eras-a Shakespeare play, a nineteenth-century novel, a contemporary
film, for example-each in terms of a variety of theoretical approaches. Can Othello be read as a feminist text? A site of class struggle? A staging of the relationship between
language and the unconscious? The course aims both to make familiar some of the critical methods students are likely to encounter in the field of literary studies these days, and to
show how such methods can transform our understanding of a text, opening surprising possibilities even in familiar works. In the process, the course will also raise broader
questions about the imperatives and usefulness of literary theory in relation to texts and worlds.
Format: seminar. Requirements: frequent short papers totaling 20 pages.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 237(F) Gender and Desire 1200-1600 (Same as COMP 237 and WGSS 237) (Gateway) (W) (D)
The celebration of “courtly love” by medieval and Renaissance writers institutionalized the notion of the desiring male subject and the desired female object that continues to
reverberate in contemporary culture. But early writers do not always, or even usually, endorse these positions uncritically, and even works that elevate heterosexual love devote
surprisingly large spaces to other kinds of desire. What does it mean, for example, that the fountain of Narcissus occupies the center of the garden of courtly love in the Romance
of the Rose? That despite the Lover’s proclaimed desire to “possess” the Rose, it is the male God of Love he kisses on the mouth? Shakespeare’s comedies end famously with
triple and quadruple marriages, but how should we read the cross-dressing and gender confusion that occupy so much of the plots beforehand? As we explore these and other
issues, we will supplement our literary readings with theoretical texts drawn from medieval and Renaissance treatises as well as contemporary feminist, psychoanalytic, and
queer theory. The goal of the course is to sharpen critical reading and writing skills across a broad range of literary forms and historical, cultural and aesthetic values. As part of the

137

Exploring Diversity Initiative, this course focuses on relationships between same-sex and heterosexual desire in a variety of major pre- and early modern works, and in the
analyses of contemporary critics who undertake to explain (or explain away) the same-sex desire in them. In doing that, of course, we explore our own values and assumptions in
a much longer historical context than usual.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, four or five papers of varying lengths involving a total of 20-25 pages of writing.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 19

ENGL 239(S) (formerly 215) Imagining Immigrants (Gateway) (W) (D)
The goal of this course is two-fold: to become more responsive readers of literature and more empathetic readers of cultural differences. As Shakespeare’s Othello demonstrates,
the conflicts, anxieties, and vulnerabilities faced by today’s immigrants have a long history. Moving physically from one culture to another but remaining imaginatively torn
between their adopted country and their country of origin, feeling at times like a stranger to both, immigrants face questions that concern us all in our increasingly global society,
questions of identity, liminality, alienation, empathy, and language. Bombarded by a language that is not their own, immigrants are constantly thinking about what words mean
both literally and symbolically. Why this word rather than another? How do humor and irony work in a foreign culture? How do writers reconcile the pressures of the present
moment with the stream of memories from the old country? How is one person’s point of view, or one society’s point of view, different from another’s? How can images and
metaphors convey the experience of constantly seeing an object, or an entire world, in terms of another?
In addition to Shakespeare’s Othello, Nicole Krauss’s History of Love, Li-Young Lee’s Rose, Tracy Kidder’s Strength in What Remains, and Stephen Frear’s film Dirty Pretty
Things, we will read personal essays and short stories by such writers as Eva Hoffman, Oscar Hijuelos, Ha Jin, Nola Kambanda, Maxine Hong Kingston, Jhumpa Lahiri, Frank
McCourt, Edward Said, and Helena Maria Viramontes.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active contributions to class discussion; four 3- to 5-page papers plus short journal entries for a total of 20 pages.

ENGL 240(F) The Novel in Theory (Same as COMP 239) (Gateway) (W)
In spite of its title, this is not a course about merely theoretical novels, unwritten or dreamily imagined works of fiction that never see the page. Rather, this course will be an
introduction to the different ways that literary critics have attempted to give a literary genre as loose, baggy, miscellaneous, and altogether hard–to–pin down as the novel a
theoretical framework, to understand how the genre developed and how it functions. For the first couple of centuries of its existence in Britain and America, the novel was
considered too popular, too commercial and unserious, and not sufficiently stylistically accomplished to merit anything like its own dedicated criticism or theory. Even now,
critics can have a hard time even agreeing upon what a novel is, much less what constitutes a theory of the novel. Henry James, for example, said a novel’s only duty was “to be
interesting,” which, when you think about it, really casts a pretty broad and abstract generic net. Today, novel theory is legion. To only name a few, one can find theories of the
novel that identify themselves as formalist, psychoanalytic, post–structuralist, Marxist, historical, and post–colonial, as well as accounts that emphasize sexuality and gender, for
example, or the novel’s trans–national development. Rather than try for an encyclopedic survey of either the novel or its theories, this course will use two or three novels as a
means of testing out a range of representative works of novel theory. We will move back and forth from the theory of the novel to its practice in order to see how novel theory has
developed over the past century, as well to see how the novel’s own academic and popular fortunes relate to its theoretical accounts. Theorists are likely to include Henry James,
Shklovsky, Benjamin, Lukacs, Barthes, Watt, McKeon, Jameson, D.A. Miller, Sedgwick, and Said. Novelists may include Austen, Dickens, George Eliot, or Henry James.
Format: seminar. Requirements: 4-5 papers. regular, substantial, and intensive participation in class.

ENGL 249(S) Love and Revolution (Same as COMP 249) (W) (Gateway)
In this course we will encounter works produced in times of historical crisis and social ferment, which are especially responsive to social currents whose logic they may not fully
articulate. The novels, plays, and films about revolution that we will study address not only the political factors behind mass uprisings and governmental overthrows, but also
seemingly quite extraneous and unrelated kinds of disturbance in the field of sexuality and gender relations. In these texts a state of political revolution almost irresistibly touches
off sexual subversiveness as well, inviting the reader or spectator to interpret just what sexual upheaval has to do with political revolution. We will take up this problem in the
setting of several historical revolutions and some literary and cinematic works that represent them: for example, the French Revolution (works such as Beaumarchais’ The
Marriage of Figaro, the Marquis de Sade’s Philosophy in the Bedroom, Weiss’s Marat/Sade); the Irish Revolution (Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World); the wave of
anarchist terrorism in turn-of-the-century Paris (Jarry’s Ubu the King); the Bolshevik Revolution (Babel’s Red Cavalry); and the Prague Spring (Kundera’s The Unbearable
Lightness of Being). We will confront such questions as why an author might suggest that revolution can only be sustained through incest and libertinism; why the threat of
anarchism is so deeply bound up with exuberant scatological excess, to the point of provoking a riot; why passionate nationalist revolutionaries should be scandalized by the idea
of oedipal violence and take refuge in myths of female purity. We will examine historical and social texts as well as artistic ones, learning how literature and history might be read
together and inversely: that is, learning to read literature or film as a kind of political event, and to read history literarily, with an eye to its rhetoric and figuration.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular class participation and four papers, totaling about 20 pages.

This course explores the persistent concern in American literature and culture with forms of freedom and captivity in works ranging from William Bradford’s Of Plimouth
Plantation to Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained. Materials studied will include novels, slave narratives, captivity narratives, photography and
feature films. We will end the course with a contemporary novel chosen by the students. Comparing the ways different genres imagine freedom and captivity, we will consider the
politics of form. Above all, we will attend to how these narratives complicate the ordinary sense of what counts as bondage, and what as freedom.

ENGL 303(F) Medieval East and West: Travel, Holy War, Storytelling (Same as ARAB 303 and COMP 315) (D)
It is frequently noted that the contemporary divide between the European West and the Arab East began as far back as the Crusades. At the same time, however, the intellectual
traditions of the European West are unimaginable without the influences of Arab learning. While the largest Christian library in Europe in the 10th century contained a mere 400
volumes, the largest library (of 70) in Muslim Cordoba contained 600,000, and the library in Cairo 2 million. European scholars traveled not only to Sicily and al-Andalus, but to
Baghdad and Cairo, to study science, medicine, philosophy, and literature. This course will explore the ways in which medieval Muslims and Christians depicted one another—
sometimes in images of intractable otherness and sometimes in negotiations of surprising sympathy. Readings will include contemporary theoretical and critical texts by Edward
Said and others; travel narratives by Marco Polo, John Mandeville, and Ibn Battuta; writings about the Crusades from both the Christian and the Muslim side; and above all
storytelling from the Thousand and One Nights, Boccaccio’s Decameron, and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. As part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, this course examines the
identities that medieval Christians and Muslims imagined for themselves and each other in ways that still linger powerfully today—to give just one example, in Osama bin
Laden’s 1998 fatwah against the United States and Pope Urban II’s invocation of the First Crusade in 1095.

ENGL 304(S) Dante (Same as COMP 317)
In the spring of 1300, Dante Alighieri entered Hell. The Divine Comedy is the record of the journey that followed. It is organized around a series of encounters with figures from
the poet’s past—for example, a former teacher damned for violating nature—as well as historical and literary figures: Ulysses, Thomas Aquinas, Plato, Virgil, Adam. Though the
Comedy is probably now best known for its savagery—the bodies split open, the Popes turned upside down and lit on fire—it is also, as Dante claims, a love story and a work of
high imaginative daring. Among its final images is a vision of paradise rendered through the precise if also mind-bending language of non-Euclidean geometry. In this course we
will read the three books of the Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso), the Vita Nuova, and brief selections from Dante’s other works. All readings will be in translation.
Format: seminar. Requirements: four written exercises, three exams, and a 10-page final paper.

A study of the origins of the Arthurian story in Welsh history and folklore and a survey of its development and transformations in the romance literature of England and the
Continent, from Chretien de Troyes to Thomas Malory, circa 1100-1500. We will pay special attention to the ways in which British/English nationalism, Celtic magic, French
courtly love and chivalry, and Christian morality combine and recombine to produce ever new meaning in familiar elements of the plot: Arthur’s birth and establishment as king,
the fellowship and adventures of his followers, the adulterous love triangle, the Quest for the Holy Grail, and, finally, Arthur’s death.

For complex reasons, Shakespeare has always revealed as much about those who speculate on him as the speculators have revealed about him. In this course, we will engage a
few plays in considerable depth: The Merchant of Venice, King Lear or Hamlet and Antony and Cleopatra. But we will also use these works as a means to engage some of the
most compelling trends in recent critical thought, including cultural theory and post-Marxist analysis, political theology, deconstruction and rhetorical theory, psychoanalytic
thought and theories of gender and sexuality. In some instances, we will look at applied criticism, in others we will simply place a theoretical work alongside a play and see what
they have to say to each other—what, for instance, would a Shakespearean reading of Jacques Lacan look like?

ENGL 320T(F) Marlowe and Shakespeare (Same as THEA 320T) (W)
In 1586, at the age of twenty-three, Christopher Marlowe wrote Tamburlaine the Great. Over the next six years-probably while moonlighting as a government spy—he went on
to produce some of the strangest and also most influential works of English drama. Then in 1593, Marlowe was murdered, stabbed through the eye in a tavern brawl. It is often
said that Marlowe’s early death, no less than his early success, made the work of Shakespeare possible. In this tutorial we will read Marlowe’s Edward II, the first popular history
play in English, and Shakespeare’s Richard II;The Jew of Malta and The Merchant of Venice; Doctor Faustus and Macbeth. We will look at ways in which Marlovian preoccupations—with lurid violence, with debasement, with self-invention—resurface in Shakespeare, in new forms. In the process we will also take up more general questions of literary
influence: What do writers borrow from each other? And how does the knowledge of indebtedness—shared to varying degrees with an audience—affect the meaning and impact
of their work? Critical readings will include essays by Harry Levin, Harold Bloom and Stephen Greenblatt.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Students will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and
comment on their partners’ papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them.

ENGL 323T(S) A Novel Education (W)
All novels are conscious of their readers; eighteenth-century novels are obsessed with them. In the century when the genre first flourished, readers are the ultimate objects of
novelists’ plots. We are addressed, teased, pleaded with, embarrassed, flattered, made fun of, praised, chided, solicited, warned, reminded, rebuked, asked for sympathy, and—always—closely watched. Eighteenth-century novelists—and their narrators—aggressively educate their readers, not only teaching us how to interpret the novel itself, but also
demanding that we self-consciously question the powers of mind and habits of heart we bring to the process of interpreting a book, ourselves, and our world. In this tutorial
course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century’s greatest novelists use in creating, shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus
principally on Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones (1749) and Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1760-67)—long, brilliantly intricate novels that go about their work in very different
ways, but that are equally committed to the project of giving their readers a novel education. We will consider—much more briefly—Fielding’s Joseph Andrews and Bunyan’s
Pilgrim’s Progress. We will also read criticism by such “reader response” theorists as Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser, and—in the individualized setting of a tutorial—students
will be asked to develop and articulate their own theories of reading by examining critically the ways in which texts affect and educate them.
Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will write a 5-6 page paper every other week, and comment on their partners’ papers in alternate weeks.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 10

ENGL 324(F) Feeling, More or Less: American Sentimentalism and Its Discontents
How much feeling is too much? This question launches the investigation taken by this class, which will read the American sentimental novel as a case study for key debates in
literary criticism about what we should read and what we should read it for. We will learn how canons and their determining standards of taste develop, tracing the logic of
arguments about literary values both aesthetic (for ambiguity and estrangement over emotional potency) and political (for the ways popular works reveal the national consciousness). We’ll identify the sentimental as a set of moves that authors, male or female, can borrow at will (and in fact, may not be able to avoid). By the end of the class, students will
be able to defend their own position on how to tell emotional manipulation from genuine feeling (or to explain whether such a distinction holds), and to argue for what values they
think ought to matter for literary criticism. We’ll read a range of authors whose works play key roles in these debates, and decide for ourselves how we feel, and what we feel, in
reading them: from sentimental standard-bearers like Harriet Beecher Stowe to unsentimental romantics like Elizabeth Stoddard, from Nathaniel Hawthorne (who griped about
the “damned scribbling women” whose books outsold his) to high-art practitioners of masculine melodrama like Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner.
Format:seminar. Requirements:active class participation and about 20 pages of writing divided across 2 or 3 essays.

ENGL 325(S) Joyce, Woolf, and Proust (Same as COMP 325)
This seminar focuses on novels by three of the most important writers of modernist fiction: Marcel Proust (Swann’s Way and Within a Budding Grove, the first two novels of his
sequence In Search of Lost Time); Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse); and James Joyce (Ulysses—a novel we will read in somewhat abridged form; newcomers to that novel as well as those who have already studied it in a prior course are welcome). By juxtaposing these pathbreaking texts, we will examine the distinctive yet
related ways in which they explore crucial preoccupations of modernism: the threat and the exhilaration of cultural loss in the face of social transformations in the early twentieth
century; the turn to memory, to art, and to objects as stays against de-stabilized subjectivity and as means of re-thinking value; the emergence of new forms of political and sexual
identity; the heightening of consciousness to the verge of transport or disintegration; and the roots and perversities of desire.

Austen and Eliot profoundly influenced the course of the novel by making internal consciousness crucial to narrative form. In this course we will explore Austen’s innovative
aesthetic strategies and the ways in which Eliot assimilated and transformed them. By placing each writer’s work in its political and philosophical context—in Austen’s case,
reactions to the aftermath of the French Revolution, in Eliot’s, to the failed mid–century European revolutions and the pressures of British imperialism—we will consider how
each writer conceives social and historical exigencies to shape dramas of consciousness. Readings will include Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and
Persuasion; Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss. The Lifted Veil; , and Daniel Deronda; selected letters and prose; essays by Burke and Marx; and recent criticism.

How do we name those things that are beyond the grasp of reason, outside the realm of intelligibility? How do we attempt to domesticate that which is foreign or other? What, to
Western Europeans, is the deep mysterious Orient but a new instance of the sublime? This course will take up the inheritance of the eighteenth-century fad in Europe for all things
Oriental that followed the translation of The Arabian Nights into French in 1707. We will read the Nights alongside Edmund Burke’s theory of the sublime and writings on the
French Revolution in order to frame an investigation of the relationship between the real politics of Empire and the politics of imperial representation. In aiming to reveal how
literary and visual texts deal with the magisterial, the infinite, the unmapped, and the mystery of the Sublime East, we will touch on important writers and artists in the long history
and aftermath of European Orientalism from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, including J.A.D. Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Goethe, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie
Collins, Bram Stoker, E.M. Forster, Jorge Luis Borges, and Salman Rushdie.
As we mine the texts and practices of Orientalism for historical and aesthetic lessons about how imagination works to conceive the other, we will also reckon with contemporary
discourses of cultural difference and in so doing, contribute to the College’s Exploring Diversity Initiative.

ENGL 335T(S) Manners, Modernity, and the Novel (Same as COMP 335T) (W)
The novel, particularly in some of its nineteenth–century British iterations, has long been nearly obsessed with taste and good form, ceaselessly preoccupied with the nicer
aspects of social life and etiquette. Historians of the “rise of the novel,” the period when novels took shape as Britain’s signal cultural form, have allied that development with the
civilizing process itself, as if novels were what both keep us from killing each other at the dinner table, and from being so uncouth as to use a fish fork to eat our salad. What’s
more, manners are at the heart of many of the novel’s own central concern, and those concerns are some of the most pressing ones of modernity: the nature of social authority
amidst increasingly fluid notions of class, the role of taste in the discourse of aesthetics, and the relation of civilization to the discontents it engenders (as Freud famously put it).
This course will think about the 19th and early–20th–century novel’s at times manic interest in good social form, using this as a way of thinking about the novel’s own formal
development and cultural status, its increasingly self–conscious sense of itself as no longer simply low entertainment, but something more refined as it enters the 20th century. We
will read novels alongside discourses of style and taste, ranging from the rise of etiquette books, to philosophical writing on aesthetics, ethics, and sociological theories of taste as
an engine of social distinction. This class also will try to see how early theories of the novel are themselves grounded in social form, asking how manners in the novel became a
manner of speaking about the novel, with the idiom of tact and well–heeled form shaping the emergence of the professional study of the novel from the early in the 20th century
onward. We will ask how something seemingly as quaint as good manners becomes a means of registering, and contending with, the vicissitudes of modernity in fiction, from the
perfection of social form in Oscar Wilde to the calculated reticence of Henry James. Finally, we will turn to a contemporary novel of manners to see what remains so productive,
terrifying, and so novelistic, about the compulsion to keep up appearances. Novelists likely to include Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Bret Easton Ellis
or Edward St. Aubyn. Theorists will include Pierre Bourdieu, Norbert Elias, Theodor Adorno, and Erving Goffman among others.

ENGL 338(S) The American Renaissance (Same as AMST 338)
The 1840s and 50s are known as “the American Renaissance,” a watershed in American literary history which includes Thoreau’s Walden and Melville’s Moby-Dick, Emerson’s
essays and Hawthorne’s fiction. It also includes major abolitionist writings by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe and the groundbreaking poetry of Walt Whitman
and Emily Dickinson. We will read through this essential period of American literature by asking how key authors figure intimacy, emotion, and experience. That inquiry, in turn,
will help us explore the formations of literary work and its interventions into the culture of a nation heading toward Civil War and conscious of its fractures. How did these authors
imagine the gulf between self and not-self, and the potential to bridge that gulf? Did the written word have the power to make readers “feel right,” as Stowe hoped, or to correct
them when they felt wrong, as Douglass attempts to do when he tells his audience that slave songs express sorrow, not joy? As we move through a rich variety of texts, we will
explore how authors try to move their readers, and how they conceive of emotion’s relationship to the individual person and to the culture at large.

William Faulkner was a great writer in two ways. First, he was the most interesting formal innovator of all the novelists of American modernism (as in The Sound and the Fury
and As I Lay Dying). Second, he was a strange and provocative theorist of race (as in Go Down, Moses and Absalom, Absalom!). We shall consider both of these dimensions of
Faulkner and what they have to do with each other. In addition, Faulkner was determined, on whatever theme he considered (sexuality, the family, money, death, time), to push
speculation to its limit, and prose to its limit in turn. We shall follow these themes insofar as they absorb us.

ENGL 350T(S) The Problem of Modernity and the Modernist Imagination (Same as COMP 349T) (W)
Historically, “modernity” refers roughly to the last four centuries, a time that saw the rise of the scientific revolution, market economies, industrialized production, and mass
democracy. Such developments radically altered the world, producing, for many, a disorienting experience of rupture with tradition and the past. All, to be sure, in the name of
progress, for the Enlightenment regarded modernity as a fundamentally moral project, one that would reduce human suffering by means of science and technology, increase the
authority of reason in public life, and extend individual rights to ever more classes of people. At the same time, however, the Enlightenment cast unacknowledged shadows of its
own making: distinctively modern ills like colonial exploitation, mechanized warfare, and widespread feelings of rootlessness and anomie. Progress and good bound up so tightly
with loss and evil, it is no wonder that modernity struck (and still strikes) many living through it as a “problem”: is modernity a good, but unfinished, project? Or is it, rather, some
kind of fateful error, which will lead to the devastation of the natural world without, and human nature within? Will it make us freer and our lives more meaningful? Or is the
freedom it promises chimerical? And can life any longer have real meaning in an impersonal world dominated by mass culture and technology? Such anxious doubts haunt
modernity, and late 19th and early 20th-century texts that give them forceful expression will be the focus of this tutorial, including: Freud’s Civilization and its Discontents,
Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, Horkheimer and Adorno’s Dialectic of Enlightenment, James’ The
Portrait of a Lady, Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, and Beckett’s Endgame.

ENGL 351(S) Modernist Poetry and Poetics
This survey of Modernist poetry and poetics focuses on writers who “make it new,” in Pound’s phrase, creating innovative forms that reflect the pressures of a period marked by
radical change. We will read many of the most remarkable poets of this immensely fertile artistic era, including Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Stein, Stevens, Loy, Moore, H.D., Williams,
Hughes, Brown, Zukofsky, Niedecker, and Oppen. While considerable time will be spent close reading poems, we will situate these writers within their social, political, and
artistic contexts, and will ask what kind of inheritance they offer to subsequent generations. Our readings will thus lead us into further discussions about the period’s many
transformations to the production and reception of poetry as a genre.

ENGL 352(S) The Global Avant Garde in Literature and Film (Same as COMP 351)
Chic, sophisticated, experimental, bohemian, radical: the words we think of when we think of the “avant garde” call to mind the great cities of Europe and America in the early
decades of the twentieth century. The usual suspects hail from Paris, London, Moscow, Rome, and primitive energies of the “uncivilized societies” in Africa, Asia, and beyond.
Can we recover these Others, these understudied but essential artists, as more than unconscious transmitters of unfamiliar cultures, and locate in their work a distinct set of
aesthetic and political practices? Can we trace the global vectors of a representational strategy that is not Euro–American but is nevertheless politically and formally radical?
Writers and directors like Jean Toomer, G.V. Desani, Amos Tutuola, Émile Habiby, Jean Genet, Aimé Césaire, Haroun Farocki, Patrick Chamoiseau, Claire Denis, and Andrea
Arnold will help us locate and consider the explosive diversity of a broader avant garde’s experiments with image, sound, and language, as well as how these texts have contributed to and put pressure on more traditionally Western modernisms.

ENGL 353(S) The Transmission of Culture
This course explores the transmission of culture through close analysis of key works of literature in a variety of genres from antiquity to the present, each of which reflects upon
its relationship to the tradition it inherits, affirms, questions, and transforms. Course texts explore such fundamental questions as: What is an author, and what is the nature of his
or her authority? What is the relationship between a writer and his or her work? Between a writer and his or her readers? What is the nature of cultural influence and what is its
relationship to originality? How do anxieties about cultural transmission inform conceptions of gender and how can one transmit or inherit a history of violation, abandonment, or
disinheritance? Readings may include works by Virgil, Dante, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chrétien de Troyes, Shakespeare, Marvell, Milton, M. Shelley, Keats, Melville, Poe,
Woolf, and Morrison.

ENGL 360(F) James Joyce’s Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most important novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce’s Ulysses, which both
dismantled the traditional novel and revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in which compelling issues of character and theme
(e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish nationalism)
are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature, and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of
comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and
narrative perspective. In addition to Joyce’s novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer’s Odyssey, as well as biographical and critical essays. Students unfamiliar with
Joyce’s short novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of the course.

ENGL 365(S) Beckett, Pinter and Stoppard (Same as THEA 365)
Over the past half century, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard have been the most influential playwrights of the anglophone theatre and beyond. This course will
explore their shared concern with the capacities and dysfunctions of language, their questioning of Art’s value and the scope for originality in the post-nuclear and postmodern
era, and, above all, their mutual focus on the extent to which selfhood may be realized in and through performance. Besides reading major plays, we will also give some consideration to the dramatic work these writers have crafted for radio, television and film, and to the political and social commitments which have animated and counterpointed their
literary careers. Readings will be drawn from: Endgame, The Birthday Party, Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Krapp’s Last Tape, The Homecoming, Arcadia, Old
Times, Betrayal, Waiting for Godot, The Invention of Love, Rock ’n’ Roll, Dogg’s Hamlet, Not I, Rockaby, A Kind of Alaska, Catastrophe, Artist Descending a Staircase and One

ENGL 366(F) Romantic Literature and Philosophy (Same as COMP 336) (W)
The Romantic writing of the late 18th and early 19th centuries represents one of the most direct and fruitful collaborations between literature and philosophy in the history of
Western culture, though historical accounts of Romanticism as a rebellion of heart against mind often seem to suggest otherwise. In this course we will see how Romantic writing
works to complicate familiar oppositions between abstract thinking and immediate feeling; cool reason and hot passion; staid contemplation and direct action; and present reality
and utopian ideality. Not only were Romantic writers frequently the self-appointed theorists of their own poetic practices, but their works also responded to the unprecedented
role given to aesthetic judgment by philosophers of their day, who granted it wide-reaching powers in the moral, political, and intellectual lives of rational animals. Through
readings of representative works, we will analyze the underpinnings of this Romantic enthusiasm for the aesthetic, and also consider the relevance of Romantic works for
contemporary debates about the relationship between ethics, politics, and aesthetics. Primary texts may include works by Kant, Coleridge, Schelling,Wordsworth, Hegel,
Hölderlin, P. Shelley, C. Smith, and Keats.

ROSENHEIM
ENGL 368(S) Ireland in Film
In 1909, James Joyce was briefly the manager of one of Dublin’s first cinemas. The medium of film has long attracted Irish writers-as a means to explore and represent the
country’s political and cultural history, to interrogate the very notion of “Irishness”, and to promote their work to a wider audience. In turn, Ireland has long provided a rich subject
for Hollywood fantasy, typically being portrayed by non-Irish directors as either a mythic space for emerald-green romanticism, or, more darkly, as a place of political terror and
entrenched ideological rivalries. In this course we will view and discuss major films from the canon of Irish cinema, with the main aim of assessing the achievement of indigenous filmmakers and the newly ascendant film movement in Ireland. We will also read the literary texts on which some films were based, so as to consider the strengths and
limitations of the medium as a resource for writers who initially worked only in print. This course will introduce participants to the technical vocabulary of film art, as well as to
key themes in modern Irish history and culture. Films to be viewed will be drawn from: Man of Aran, The Informer, The Quiet Man, Eat the Peach, In the Name of the Father,
Butcher Boy, Intermission, The Playboys, Into the West, The Field, The Crying Game, December Bride, The Commitments, Michael Collins, Ondine, and In Bruges; and we will
also assess one or more short independent films such as Budawanny and Adam and Paul. Special attention will be given to the directorial work of Neil Jordan, Jim Sheridan and
Terry George.

ENGL 378(S) Nature/Writing (Same as ENVI 378)
What do we mean by “nature”? How do we understand the relationships between “nature” and “culture”? In this course we will examine how various American writers have
attempted to render conceptions of “nature” in literary form. We will compare treatments of various kinds of natural environments and trace the philosophical and stylistic
traditions within the nature writing genre. The authors to be considered include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Faulkner, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez,
Ursula LeGuin, and Wendell Berry.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two 10-page papers, regular class attendance, and participation in discussions.

ENGL 379(F) Promiscuity and the Novel
The novel is frequently described in terms of the “marriage plot,” but the form might better be seen as exploring multiple emotional and sexual partnerships. This course will
examine fiction where serial entanglements are the norm in order to ask why the novel has been so interested in faithlessness. We’ll cover fiction from the eighteenth to the
twentieth century, in several genres: the sentimental novel, nineteenth-century realism, sci-fi, Latin American urban literature, and queer fiction. Questions to be explored: the

142

historical mutations in the meanings and narrative function of promiscuity; its association with sexual minorities, women, working-class people and aristocrats; the relations
between eroticism and commerce.
Possible authors to be studied: Daniel Defoe, Laurence Sterne, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, Jane Austen, Émile Zola, James Baldwin, Ursula K. LeGuin, Samuel Delany, Roberto Bolaño.

ENGL 381(S) Beyond the Harlem Renaissance: Black Modernisms and the Great Migration (Same as AFR 380 and AMST 381)
Courses on “the Harlem Renaissance” have long been standard fare in college curricula, but this rubric is too narrow to encompass the dramatic changes in early 20th century
African American culture that made possible the careers of writers like Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Instead, we’ll
begin with a question: how did the term “urban” became a euphemism for African American culture? A hundred years ago, many informed commentators scorned the notion
that African American populations might become other than what they had been for centuries—overwhelmingly rural and Southern. The massive social phenomenon that
changed this status, by which millions of impoverished workers sought new lives in the industrial cities of the North, Midwest, and West Coast, is arguably the most significant
event in African American history in the 20th century, and has become known as “the Great Migration.” (Or, the “Great Migrations”—scholars like to pluralize everything these
days—it’s complicated!) “Black modernisms” should take the plural, too: as we’ll see, the concept of modernism in Euro-American culture depended on a racialized theory of
history and civilization that consigned people of color to the past (or, occasionally, the future), even as it was irrevocably shaped by influences of, appropriations from, and
collaboration with peoples of color who saw modernity as a chance they were determined to claim for themselves. What became known as “the Harlem Renaissance” was the
most famous U.S. example of such a cultural movement, but we’ll explore it in a longer and more aesthetically, politically, and regionally diverse context. The artists and critics
we’ll examine, in addition to those mentioned above, may include Hubert Harrison, Jean Toomer, Marita Bonner, Richard Bruce Nugent, Bessie Smith, Richard Wright, David
Levering Lewis, Cheryl Wall, and Brent Hayes Edwards
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, frequent short writing assignments, a midterm take-home exam, and a final project.

ENGL 388(S) Genres of the City
How do you tell a story about an entire city? Could even the most capacious of novels be vast enough to contain London itself? Or, by different means, could the sublime
miniaturizations of lyric poetry reproduce the perils and pleasures of delving into the city’s thronged streets? This course asks by what literary devices might a writer wrap her or
his arms, as it were, around the modern metropolis as it emerged in nineteenth-century Britain. We will focus on a series of efforts by writers as they test out a range of literary
genres large and small-the realist novel, the urban sketch, the lyric poem, among others-in order to figure the modern urban scene in all its buzzy, bewildering glory. Some of our
questions: Does the city have a literary genre? Do literary forms produce a kind of cognitive map of urban terrain? Do novels need cities, as engines of plot and complexity? Do
cities need novels, as symbolic forms to apprehend this vast new urban space? What about poems? How is urban consciousness, or disorientation, best rendered on the page? Or,
is the project of rendering the metropolis in literature a sort of genre vampirism, a literary usurping of the forms of experience afforded by the modern city? Alongside literary
texts, we will read a number of historical and contemporary theorists of the city and its genres. Among our authors: Wordsworth, Blake, Dickens, Mayhew, Wilde, Conan Doyle,
James. Among our theorists: Fredric Jameson, Georg Simmel, Erving Goffman, Walter Benjamin, Franco Moretti.
Format: seminar. Requirements: 3 essays, short response papers, regular and considered contributions to class discussion.

ENGL 392(S) Wonder (Same as COMP 392)
We tend to imagine “wonder” as a naive, wide-eyed response, something quite distinct from the cold and sophisticated act of critical analysis. In this discussion class, we will
consider wonder as an eminently analyzable concept, but one that raises provocative questions about the nature and limits of our own, distinctly modern forms of critical engagement. The course examines three historical incarnations of “wonder,” each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains: the Renaissance
tradition on wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century analysis of the sublime; and twentieth-century accounts of the culture of spectacle. We will consider writers such
as Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Wordsworth, Borges, and W.G. Sebald (all wonderful); painters such as Leonardo and Vermeer, the photography of Andreas Gursky and
Thomas Struth; films including Lang’s Metropolis and Scott’s Blade Runner; and critical philosophical writers, including Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, and Walter Benjamin.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three papers totaling 20 pages.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 20

ENGL 394(S) Modern Pleasure (Same as WGSS 396) (D)
This course investigates the modernist imagination of pleasure, both sensual and aesthetic, with a particular focus on the ways that modernism’s formal strategies facilitate the
representation of queer pleasures, affections, intimacies, and desires. We will read some texts that seek explicitly to represent queer sexualities; we will look at others that radically re-imagine the feeling and expression of pleasure. We will approach these texts through the questions: What constitutes “modern” pleasure? What makes pleasure (or a
representation of it) queer? And do queer textual expressions of pleasure differ from representations of LGBT sexualities and desires? In tandem with our discussion of literary
form, we will consider the crucial role that subcultural sites of intimacy, like Harlem’s cabarets and Natalie Barney’s sapphic salon, played in the collaborative production and
transatlantic circulation of modernism. Authors likely to be studied include Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes, Nella Larsen, Radclyffe Hall, Willa
Cather, and James Baldwin. We will also consider visual and aural texts, including photographs of the Barney salon, cubist portraits and landscapes, and the music of Gertrude
“Ma” Rainey. We will read the work of sexologists and situate modernist literature in relation to early 20th—century scientific and cultural conversations about the nature of
pleasure. Some contemporary scholarship on modernist sexual culture and much queer and feminist theory will accompany these texts and provide a framework for our analysis
of modernism’s queer pleasures.
Format: seminar. Requirements: engaged and thoughtful discussion; one 5- to 7-page paper and one 8- to 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Enrollment limit: 15

ENGL 396(S) Happiness
Happiness is one big puzzle. The Greek philosophers were largely agreed that nothing was more important, but they couldn’t agree on how to get it. The Declaration of Independence makes a big deal about it, and yet modern politicians talk about happiness almost not at all. They offer to make us freer or safer or richer, but they almost never say they’ll
make us happier. Academic psychologists, meanwhile, have shown that we’re really bad at identifying what will make us happy; we think we know, and we’re usually wrong.
Some living philosophers have concluded that we don’t even know what the word means. In this seminar, we’ll have to ask all the hard questions: What is happiness? What
makes people happy? How do you decide what kind of life is worth living? Does happiness change from society to society or culture to culture? Is there a politics to happiness?
What, if anything, does happiness have to do with justice? Why does the song tell you to clap your hands ”if you’re happy and you know it”? Is it possible to be happy and not
know it? Are some of us happy behind our own backs? The course will be held inside the Berkshire county jail; enrollment will be divided equally between Williams students and
residents of the jail. Final enrollment will be settled on the basis of face–to–face interviews with the instructor. The jail setting is a way of opening up the classroom to the one
group that college students almost never get to hear from around the seminar table: people who have not thought of themselves as college–bound. One class meeting per week.
Please note that class will be held on Tuesday evenings; attendance is required, except in cases of emergency. Transportation will be provided by the college.
Format:seminar/discussion.Requirements:short weekly writing assignment; final essay, 12–15 pages.

ENGL 414(S) Donne, Shakespeare, and Wroth (Same as WGSS 414) (W)
“Wit! Wonder-exciting vigour, intenseness and peculiarity of thought,” Samuel Coleridge wrote, “this is the wit of Donne!” There are no greater, wittier, or more daringly original
lyric poems in the English language than Donne’s Songs and Sonnets, Shakespeare’s Sonnets, or Mary Wroth’s Pamphilia to Amphilathus, the first collection of secular poems
written and published by an Englishwoman.
This intensive, discussion-oriented seminar will explore the following questions. What are these writers’ stylistic characteristics? How peculiar or unconventional are these
poems, and what innovations do they seek? What is the impact of their coterie audience? How do questions of sexuality and gender animate these poems? To what extent are
biography and history pertinent or helpful in understanding this poetry? Why have these poems inspired such provocative critical responses from modernists, and more recently,
post-modernists?
Format: seminar. Requirements: We will spend three weeks discussing each poet during which time students will write weekly journal entries. The last three weeks of the
semester will be spent writing, reading, and discussing drafts of final seminar papers, which are due at the end of reading period.
Prerequisites: a 300-level ENGL course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to junior and senior English majors, but sophomores and other majors are encouraged to apply.

WANG
ENGL 423(S) History in Theory
Moments of political turmoil expose the contested and highly charged ways in which a culture structures itself around an imagined past, a process that some of the most interesting theorists of the past two hundred years have helped to illuminate. In this course, we will read their work along with literary and cinematic texts that invoke such moments of
upheaval—the French and Russian Revolutions as well as those of 1848, the rise of fascism and the Great Depression of the 1930s, the battle for Algerian independence, the
AIDS crisis—in order to lay bare the problems and contradictions that emerge in those fraught narratives of the past. We will consider such issues as the aesthetics of fascism and
of democracy under pressure, fantasies of decolonization, and the uses of melancholy in representing historical loss. Readings will be drawn from literary works by Austen, Eliot,
Kafka, Mann, Borges, Stoppard, and Kushner, and theoretical essays by Kant, Burke, Carlyle, Marx, Weber, Benjamin, Adorno, Foucault, de Certeau, and Lefort. Films will
include such works as Eisenstein’s October, Reifenstahl’s The Triumph of the Will, Wellman’s Nothing Sacred and Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers. This course is conceived
for students who have already taken a criticism course, but those students who have yet to do so are welcome.
Format: seminar, with a week or so of tutorials and a chance for independent work. Requirements: one 5-page paper and a final fifteen-page paper, with a process of revisions.

ENGL 456 Special Topics in American Literature: Derrida (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course is for students of any major who wish to continue studying critical, cultural, or literary theory. Students will give close attention to a single theorist or philosophical
school or perhaps to a single question as taken up by several theorists. Prior coursework in critical theory or continental philosophy, no matter the department, is strongly recommended. The subject of this semester’s seminar is Jacques Derrida. We often think of language as best when it is living and intimate: words spoken to a lover, arguments shared
around a seminar table, the poet we finally get to hear read her works out loud. But it is Derrida’s signature argument that language is never really intimate in these ways-that it is
always adrift, separated at once from the person who speaks or writes it, from the person to whom it is addressed, and from the things in the world that it putatively names. The
words you speak and write aren’t really yours; nor can you ever be sure they will carry the meanings you intend them to have; nor can you guarantee that they will reach the
people for whom they were devised, or that they will reach only them. Derrida’s core claim is that this is nothing to worry about-that, on the contrary, a liberated philosophy will
have to keep faith with a language thus unfixed. We will spend the semester considering this idea and reckoning its consequences for our understandings of literature, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and law.
Format: seminar. Requirements: seminar paper of 25 pages; informal weekly writing; class attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam. Prior coursework in critical

Environmental issues call upon citizens, organizations, and other agencies to grasp complex science, address conflicting human values, and make difficult ethical and political
choices. The three curricular options in Environmental Studies—the majors in Environmental Policy and Environmental Science and the concentration in Environmental Studies—are designed to prepare students to deal effectively with these issues by integrating perspectives and methodologies from the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the
arts and humanities.

145

The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Harper House. Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies
programs at a liberal arts college. In addition to the academic program described below, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead and participate, often
with other members of the Williams community. CES offers extensive resources including library materials and databases, GIS facilities, and funding for student-initiated activities, summer research and internships. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2600-acre natural area northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory,
and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons. CES also operates the Environmental Analysis Laboratory in Morley Science Center.
The Program in Environmental Studies offers three distinct curricular options: students may decide to pursue either a major in Environmental Policy or Environmental Science or to complement a major in a different area with a concentration in Environmental Studies. Students may not double-major in Environmental Policy and Environmental
Science or combine either major with a concentration in Environmental Studies.
The majors and the concentration share a common “core” of four courses: ENVI 101, 203, 302, and 402. The core courses are designed to be taken in sequence, with ENVI
302 and ENVI 402 normally reserved for senior majors and concentrators. ENVI 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social sciences. ENVI
203 is a course in ecology (offered by the Biology department) that provides a unified conceptual approach to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 is an
experiential course that puts teams of students to work on projects of immediate significance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for majors and
concentrators to draw together their interdisciplinary educational experiences and apply what they have learned to specific environmental issues. The core course structure
affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102, is also required for students majoring in Environmental Policy or Environmental Science. Environmental
Studies concentrators are also strongly encouraged to take ENVI 102.

Advising in Environmental Studies
Students interested in pursuing a major or concentration sponsored by CES should seek advising from program faculty as early as possible. Students who decide to major in
either Environmental Policy or Environmental Science are required to identify a track through the major and a faculty advisor from the list below at the time of declaration. Both
the advisor’s signature and that of the Director of the Center for Environmental studies are required on the major declaration form.
Track:
Political Economy
Political Theory and Law
Society & Culture
Environmental Biology
Environmental Chemistry

The ‘Four Places’ Goal and Study Away:
Learning about particular places is an essential part of Environmental Studies. By the time each student graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and
personal experience of four places: “Home,” “Here,” “There,” and “The World.” For practical purposes, “Here” is the Berkshires and “There” is a place where the geography and
socioeconomic circumstances are outside the student’s previous experience. Although this goal is not a requirement of the majors or the concentration, it is a significant aspect of
the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet it. For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer internships in their “Home”
communities, and field courses in natural science, environmental planning, and other areas can deepen familiarity with “Here.” Summer recess and Winter Study provide many
excellent opportunities for research and other learning outside the New England region.
A wide variety of study away options is available to students in Environmental Studies, including the Williams Mystic program. Students in Environmental Studies are
encouraged to study a foreign language and to spend all or part of their junior year abroad. Students considering either a semester or year away should consult both the CES
Director and the study abroad office as early as possible to discuss their options. Up to two courses for the majors and three courses for the concentration may be taken outside of
Williams. Approval for courses taken elsewhere must be granted in writing by the Director of CES.

Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Policy, Environmental Science or Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous independent research project under
the supervision of a member of the CES faculty. Juniors who wish to apply for the honors program should submit a 5-page proposal to their intended advisor and the Director of
CES by the end of spring break. If a student wishes to work with a faculty member not affiliated with CES, the student must also identify a co-advisor from within the program.
Students will be notified by the end of the semester whether or not their proposal has been approved.
Students in the honors program are required to present their preliminary findings at a meeting of CES students, faculty and staff in November. The final research project should
be reported as a written thesis and presented orally before a faculty committee convened for that purpose. Environmental Studies concentrators may undertake an honors thesis
and submit it to both their major department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the department chair and the Director of the
program by the end of the junior year. Majors and concentrators who pursue honors in Environmental Policy, Environmental Science or Environmental Studies alone should
enroll in ENVP 493-W31-494, ENVS 493-W31-494, or ENVI 493-W31-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements of the major or concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory or archival work that is difficult to combine with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to
spend the summer before senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the CES, and an open competition is
held each spring to allocate funding resources. Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan the
thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
Honors will be awarded on the basis of the academic merit and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis. The following timeline has been established for students pursuing honors in 2013-14:
Wednesday, October 30 (7:00 pm)
Preliminary presentation of research results
Friday, May 2 (7:00 pm)
Defense of honors thesis
Friday, May 16 (5:00 pm)
Delivery of final thesis to Director of CES
Failure to meet any one of these deadlines will result in removal from the honors program.

THE MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
The major in Environmental Policy brings together core courses in Environmental Studies with relevant coursework in related fields including Economics and Political
Science. The goal of the Environmental Policy major is to combine scientific literacy with an understanding of the economic, political and cultural structures involved in institutional decision-making on environmental matters. Eight courses are common to all Environmental Policy majors; there are also three distinct tracks through the major, each of
which entails an additional theory/methods course and two electives. The three tracks through the major are a) Political Economy, b) Political Theory and Law, and c) Society and
Culture. Environmental Policy majors are also encouraged to take GEOS 214 Remote Sensing and GIS. Students majoring in Environmental Policy should investigate the
courses required for their chosen track and consult their advisor to plan an appropriate schedule for completing the major, including any prerequisites not listed below. Courses
cannot be double-counted within the major; for example, a course used to fulfill the theory/methods requirement cannot also be used as an elective. The availability of required
courses may vary slightly from year to year, and substitutions may be authorized occasionally by the Director of CES. Environmental Policy majors will be exempt from taking
Econ 110 if they received a score of 5 on the Microeconomics AP exam, a 6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, or an A or B in economics in A-levels. Students
seeking exemption from ENVI 102 on the basis of exam results should consult the Director of CES.

THE MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
The major in Environmental Science brings together core courses in Environmental Studies with relevant coursework in a specific scientific discipline. The goal of the major
in Environmental Science is to provide training in one of the natural sciences as well as an understanding of the complex array of natural, social and political factors involved in
environmental issues. Five courses are common to all Environmental Science majors; there is also a methods requirement and three disciplinary tracks, each comprised of five
additional courses. The three disciplinary tracks are a) Environmental Biology, b) Environmental Chemistry, and c) Environmental Geosciences. Students majoring in Environmental Science should investigate the courses required for their chosen track and consult their advisor to plan an appropriate schedule for completing the major, including any
prerequisites not listed below. Courses cannot be double-counted within the major; for example, a course used to fulfill the methods requirement cannot also be used as an
elective. The availability of required courses may vary slightly from year to year, and substitutions may be authorized occasionally by the Director of CES. Students seeking to
place out of particular courses on the basis of AP, IB or A-level exams should consult the Director.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies concentration provides students with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physical, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The concentration is designed so that students will understand the complexity of issues and perspectives and appreciate that most environmental
issues lack distinct disciplinary boundaries. The goal of the concentration is to educate students to be well-informed, environmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the
capacity to become active participants in the local and global community. To this end, the concentration is designed to develop the capability to think in interdisciplinary ways and
to use synthetic approaches to solve problems while incorporating the knowledge and experiences gained from majoring in other departments at the College. The concentration
in Environmental Studies consists of four core courses and one elective course in each of the three divisions: natural science, social science, and humanities and arts.

ENVI 101(F) Nature and Society: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies as an interdisciplinary field of learning. It will provide a survey of a broad range of environmental problems, cases, and questions,
from climate change to sustainable agriculture, from toxic waste to species extinction. We will also examine the intellectual traditions, authors, and historical developments that
have most profoundly shaped our understanding of these issues. Keeping a constant eye on the complexities of life in the twenty-first century, we will explore the many different
theories and methods that inform environmental scholarship, activism, and policy-making in a variety of cultural arenas and across geographical scales. Along the way, we will
read works by philosophers, economists, journalists, historians, sociologists, and many others.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements/Evaluation: evaluation will be based on participation, in-class exercises, several writing assignments and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 35).
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF, 1:10-2:25 TF

ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science Methods
Environmental science is the interdisciplinary study of the Earth’s systems through the synthesis of physical, chemical, geological, and biological perspectives. This course
introduces students to the scientific methods used to assess human impacts on the environment. Through this course students will be introduced to scientific literature on local and
regional issues and place them in a global context The environmental policy implications of the local and regional data that is collected also will be examined through discussions
and class debates. We will explore the physical/natural environmental processes within the local Hoosic River Watershed through field and laboratory exercises, these local
findings then will be interpreted in the broader context of the downstream watersheds and landscapes in which the Hoosic is situated, namely the Hudson River, and ultimately
the Atlantic Ocean. Examples of topics covered are: linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, climate change, human impacts on water quality, acid rain, toxic metals,
human influences on hydrology, ecosystem restoration/remediation, and waste treatment. Some to the analyses of these topics will be through short lab reports, while the applications of these science topics to policy issues will be explored through classroom debates. Students design and complete an independent project on one of these subjects as it
pertains to their hometown. There will be an all–day field trip through the Hoosic River Valley early in the semester.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, student debates, class discussion participation, independent project presentation and paper.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 36). Preference given to first-year students. This course is an introductory science seminar, designed for students who have a strong interest in
Environmental Science. It is a required course for the majors in Environmental Policy and Environmental Science and satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement. This

ENVI 208(F) Science and Politics in Environmental Decision Making (D)
This course explores the relationship between science and politics in environmental decision-making. How do legislators know when a species is endangered and warrants
protection? What precautions should be applied in allowing genetically modified foods onto our plates? Can we, and should we, weigh the risks of malaria against the impacts of
pesticides used to control those mosquitoes that transmit the disease? How has the global community come together to understand the risks from global climate change, and how
has this understanding shaped our policy responses? What are some of the limits of science in shaping policy outcomes? In addressing these and other questions, we will pay
particular attention to how power relations and existing institutions shape what knowledge, and whose knowledge, is taken on board in decision-making, be it at the local,
national or global level. We will delve into how these dynamics shape policy outcomes and we will also examine novel approaches for incorporating the knowledge of traditionally disempowered groups, including indigenous and local communities.
Format: lecture/discussion with some role-play exercises. Requirements: several shorter writing assignments and two 5- to 7-page essays.

This course will explore the environmental implications of everyday life in modern America. It will ask how cultural, political, economic, and ecological systems interact to
produce ordinary places and vernacular landscapes, from campuses to cul-de-sacs, farms to forests, nation-states to national parks. Combining approaches from cultural
geography, environmental history, and political ecology, it will focus on the hidden lives of “things”—the commodities and technologies that form the basic building blocks
of place: food, oil, water, wood, machines. With strong emphasis on local-global relations, it will look beneath the surface of the ordinary to reveal the complex networks of
power, meaning, and matter that connect “here” to “there,” “now” to “then,” and “us” to “them.” In so doing, it will pursue parallel goals: to understand the socio-spatial
processes shaping today’s global environment; and to explore the cultural systems through which those processes are understood and contested. Topics will include the
bottled water controversy, factory farming and local agriculture, the political economy of lawns, and the cultural politics of invasive species.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays and several shorter writing assignments.
No prerequisites; open to first-years. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).
This course satisfies the “Theory/Methods” requirement for the Society & Culture track through the Environmental Policy major and the “Humanities, Arts and Social
Sciences” requirement of the Environmental Studies concentration.

ENVI 212(F) “Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)”: African American Environmental Culture from Slavery to Environmental Justice (Same as AFR 218 and
AMST 214) (D)
Until the environmental justice movement rose to prominence over the past few decades and invited a more critical perspective on the connection between race and the environment, popular understanding of the American environmental (and environmentalist) tradition had effectively been whitewashed. But why? This course will work to find answers
to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of African American environmental culture in conversation with key moments in African American history – from slavery to
sharecropping, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. With an interdisciplinary approach that considers sources as diverse as slave narratives, fiction, poetry,
songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies, we will consider African American intellectuals, writers, and visual and musical artists not always associated with environmental
thought, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and Marvin Gaye.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation considers active, informed participation in class discussion based on assigned readings, midterm and final exams, and three 5–7 page
essays. Students are also expected to research and respond to at least three news articles exploring some aspect of the intersection between race and the environment over the
course of the semester, and to share your findings with the class for discussion. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement by examining the themes of
empathetic understanding and power and privilege. Among many other paths of inquiry, we will examine how African American environmental culture has evolved in conversation with an historical context of discrimination, racism, and inequality.
No prerequisites; open to first–year and continuing students. Enrollment limit: 20 (Expected:15).
May not be taken pass/fail. Not available for the Gaudino option.

ENVI 217 Environmental “isms”: Ideology in the Environmental Humanities (Same as AMST 216) (D) (Not offered 2013-2014)
How does culture shape our use and imagination of the physical environment? And how does the physical environment shape culture in turn? These are the central questions of the environmental humanities. This course will explore the various ways in which scholars from a broad range of disciplines have sought to answer these questions
by incorporating insights from social theory and cultural criticism. Focusing on studies of socio-environmental conflict in the United States and Latin America from the
time of European colonization to the present, it will examine key works from environmental history, ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and cultural geography, and it
will survey the major methodological and theoretical commitments that unite these fields. Emphasis will be placed on environmental justice and the ideological critique of
modernity. How have scholars made environmental sense of liberalism, colonialism, capitalism, nationalism, sexism, and racism? How have these “isms” influenced our
relations with the natural world, and how can the humanities help us both understand and change these relations for the better? This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity
requirement.

ENVI 219(F) Topics in Sustainable Agriculture (Same as ANTH 218)
What does sustainability mean in the context of agricultural practice, food production, and consumption? This course encourages students to think analytically and critically
about the meanings and practices of sustainability in the context of food and agriculture. We examine diverse regional and historic contexts to explore how concerns about
sustainability in relation to agricultural production and food consumption emerged, and explore the contemporary incarnations of sustainable agriculture in organic, fair trade, and
local agriculture as well as in debates around food miles, biofuels, and genetic modification. Cutting across each of these individual topics, we will think about the connections
between production and consumption, ecology and society. By the end of this course, it is expected that students will develop a multifaceted understanding of the social, political
and cultural dimensions of sustainable food and agriculture.

ENVI 283 Dirty Politics: Regulating Hazardous Chemicals and Wastes (Same as PSCI 283) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Since consumers were first introduced to the promise of “better living through chemistry,” society has had to wrestle with the impacts, often far removed in place and time,
resulting from a rapid proliferation of hazardous chemicals and wastes. Policy responses, be they at the local, national or global scale, are often limited to reactionary efforts to
counter releases into the environment, are constrained by the prevalent use of the technologies in question, and further bring to the fore key challenges of environmental justice
and risk management.
How then are we to regulate DDT without adversely affecting our fight against mosquito-borne malaria? How might we preserve the ozone layer while still maintaining the

151

benefits of food preservation through refrigeration? How can we reap the benefits of the electronic age without condoning the steady flow of electronic waste affecting workers’
health and environments in developing countries? Emphasis will be placed on understanding the politics that bring about, and allow us to address, these problems. We will be
examining in particular novel policy responses, including Europe’s precautionary safe-use law, citizen-science initiatives and consumer-driven certification schemes.

ENVI 291 Religion and the American Environmental Imagination (Same as REL 291 and SOC 291) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course examines the relationship between religious and environmental thought in the modern United States. Focusing on the complex and closely linked legacies of Christianity, secularism, and popular spirituality, we will explore the religious and anti-religious roots of contemporary environmental discourse. Along the way, we will pursue a set of
vexing questions about environmental thought: Is environmentalism a religion? If so, what kind of religion is it? If not, why not (and why do we even ask)? Is anti-environmentalism religiously motivated? Could religion be the cause of our ecological crisis? Could it be the solution? For answers, we will look to the writings of thinkers such as John Muir,
Edward Abbey, Rachel Carson, Aldo Leopold, and Wendell Berry, as well as a number of lesser-known authors. We will read these authors alongside recent scholarship in the
social sciences and humanities to understand how their thinking was influenced by social and environmental trends such as urbanization, industrialization, immigration, and
globalization. We will also ask how religion has intersected with gender, race, class, and ethnicity to shape environmental politics in the twenty-first century. Finally, we will pay
particularly close attention to episodes of conflict and cooperation between the environmental movement and religious conservatives during the past forty years, and we will
analyze popular religious media from this period alongside the writings and visual productions of environmentalists.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 15-to18-page research paper and several shorter writing assignments.
Prerequisites: ENVI 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 17). Preference given to Environmental Studies majors and concentrators.

ENVI 302(F) Environmental Planning Workshop
This interdisciplinary course introduces the theories, approaches, methodologies, and legal framework of environmental planning and provides students with experience in the
planning process through project work in the Berkshire region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis and discussion of case
studies. In the second part of the course students tackle an actual planning problem. Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in the community and under
supervision of the instructor, conduct a planning project, using all the tools of an environmental planner. The project work draws on students’ academic training, extracurricular
activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course includes several class presentations and culminates in a public presentation of each team’s
planning study. This course also includes field trips, town meetings, interviews, survey work, and computer mapping labs.
Format: seminar discussion/project lab. Requirements: short written exercises, class presentations, public presentations, and final group report..
Prerequisites: ENVI 101 and BIOL/ENVI 203, or permission of instructors; open to juniors and seniors only; preference given to senior Environmental Policy and Environmental Science majors and Environmental Studies concentrators. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16).

GARDNER
ENVI 303 Cultures of Climate Change (Same as SOC 303) (W) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course asks why people think and talk about climate change in such very different ways. Climate change is a physical phenomenon that can be observed, quantified,
and measured. But it is also an idea, and as such it is subject to the vagaries of cultural interpretation. Despite scientific agreement about its existence and its causes, many
people do not see climate change as a serious problem, or as a problem at all. Many others see it as the most serious problem our species has ever faced. What are the
sources of this disparity? Why can’t we agree about climate change? How does something as complex and confusing as climate change become a “problem” in the first
place? This course will explore a broad array of factors, from religion to race, class to colonialism. It will focus especially closely on the communication of scientific
knowledge, risk perception, and environmental ethics, and it will apply a range of theories from the social sciences and humanities to a set of concrete case studies In the
climate change debate, culture matters. By investigating how culture shapes the politics and policy of climate change, students will develop the interpretive skills required to
understand not just this most contentious of issues, but environmental issues in general.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 15-to18-page research paper and several shorter writing assignments.
Prerequisites: ENVI 101. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to ENVI majors and concentrators first; ANSO majors second.
Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.
HOWE
ENVI 307(F) Environmental Law (Same as PSCI 317)
We rely on environmental laws to make human communities healthier and protect the natural world, while allowing for sustainable economic growth. Yet, despite 40 years of
increasingly varied and complex legislation, balancing human needs and environmental quality has never been harder than it is today.
Environmental Studies 307 analyzes the transformation of environmental law from fringe enterprise to fundamental feature of modern political, economic and social life. ENVI
307 also addresses the role of community activism in environmental law, from local battles over proposed industrial facilities to national campaigns for improved corporate
citizenship.
By the completion of the semester, students will understand both the successes and failures of modern environmental law and how these laws are being reinvented, through
innovations like pollution credit trading and “green product” certification, to confront globalization, climate change and other emerging threats.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on several short writing assignments, a term research project, and active participation in class.
Prerequisites: ENVI 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25.

ENVI 320(S) Cultivating the Local: Place-based Productions of Food and Agriculture (Same as ANTH 320)
This course explores the relation between ideas and practices relating to nature, food and agriculture, and specific formations of place, locality and region. Through this course we
will lay conceptual and theoretical foundations for understanding the productions of place, nature, food and agriculture, and the interconnections among them. How do socially
constructed ideas about nature, agrarian landscapes, and even particular environmental qualities such as soil and water, shape the formation of categories such as city, country,
and region or even of specific food products? Through what processes do particular food products come to be distinctively place-based? How do we understand the seeming shift

152

to place-based agriculture and food production, in the context of an industrialized and increasingly intricate global food system that has often homogenized and standardized food
production? How is locality produced through food and agriculture, and how are food and agriculture produced through claims to locality and place? These interconnections, and
the relations of power interlaced in them, are salient in contemporary praxis, and the course builds on grounded, conceptual understandings to explore contemporary phenomena
such as the appellation d’origine contrôlée in France’s wine producing regions, the development of Geographic Indication within the World Trade Organization, the formation of
“Organic Uttarakhand” that is the subject of my own research, and the affective economies generated through artisanal food production. Through an interdisciplinary approach
that brings together scholarship in anthropology, social and cultural history, sociology, and cultural geography, this course aims to foster expansive, grounded and critical understandings about the connections among nature, food, agriculture and place-making.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students are required to submit reading responses before each class, complete a take-home mid-term, and design and conduct an original research project which will provide the basis for a final research paper.
Prerequisites: ENVI 101. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

Associates: BAARLI, BRANDRISS.
MAJOR
The Geosciences major offers an understanding of the evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems. In this era of global change, geoscience provides the tools that
can help us learn to live sustainably with our environment, and appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth create mountain ranges and ocean
basins and drive the movements of continents. Wind, water and ice shape the surface of the Earth, making and changing the landscapes around us. Sedimentary rocks and the
fossils within them teach us how life and climate have evolved over the vastness of time.
Geosciences graduates have a wide range of career options, both with and without graduate training. The many choices include environmental consulting, hazard assessment
hydrology, gemology, the energy and mining industries, outdoor education, and research and teaching in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Many students choose to
double-major in fields as diverse as Art, Economics, History, Physics, Mathematics, English, and Philosophy, and often find jobs where they can apply the synergies of their
Geosciences double major. No matter what field they enter, all our Geosciences graduates pursue their lives and careers with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around
them.

The Geosciences major includes at most two 100-level courses:
GEOS 101
GEOS 102
GEOS 103
GEOS 104

The Co-Evolution of Earth and Life
An Unfinished Planet
Global Warming and Natural Disasters
Oceanography

At least two 200-level courses selected from this group:
GEOS 201 Geomorphology
GEOS 202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
GEOS 212/BIOL 211 Paleobiology
GEOS 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
GEOS 215 Climate Changes

At least two 300-level courses selected from this group:
GEOS 301 Structural Geology
GEOS 302 Sedimentology
GEOS 303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology

The senior seminar:
GEOS 401 Global Tectonics and the Rise of Mountains

Finally, students must take enough electives to bring the total to a minimum of nine courses.
Geosciences embrace a very broad range of subjects. It is therefore possible—although not required—for students to focus on sub-disciplines within the major. Possible
groupings are listed below as guidelines to assist students, but any array of courses that satisfies the requirements laid out above is acceptable for the major. Further advice on the
major can be obtained from the department chair, and all Geosciences faculty are happy to discuss course choices with individual students.
I Environmental Geosciences. For students interested in surface processes, climate change, and the application of geology to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental impact analysis, and environmental law. Students interested in this track may choose to double-major in Environmental Science.
GEOS 101/ENVI 105 The Co-Evolution of Earth and Life
GEOS/ENVI 103 Global Warming and Natural Disasters
GEOS/ENVI/MAST 104 Oceanography
GEOS 201 Geomorphology
GEOS 202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
GEOS 205 Earth Resources
GEOS/ENVI 206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
GEOS/ENVI 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
GEOS/ENVI 215 Climate Changes
GEOS/ENVI 218T The Carbon Cycle and Climate
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Cook.)
II Earth Surface Processes and Life. For students interested in the study of modern and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
GEOS 101/ENVI 105 The Co-Evolution of Earth and Life
GEOS/ENVI/MAST 104 Oceanography
GEOS 201 Geomorphology
GEOS 202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
GEOS/ENVI 206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
GEOS 212/BIOL 211 Paleobiology
GEOS/ENVI 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
GEOS/ENVI 218T The Carbon Cycle and Climate
GEOS 302 Sedimentology
(Students interested in Earth Surface, Processes and Life should consult with Professor Cox or Cohen.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
GEOS 102 An Unfinished Planet
GEOS 202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
GEOS 205 Earth Resources
GEOS/ENVI 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
GEOS 301 Structural Geology
GEOS 303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
GEOS 360T Geology of the Appalachians
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in biology, chemistry, mathematics and statistics, or physics may be substituted for elective
courses in the major. Credit may be granted in the Geosciences major for Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Processes) or Maritime Studies 311/Biology
231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should consult with faculty to ensure that they have completed courses typically expected by graduate programs. Most
graduate programs will expect students to have a background in mathematics as well a year or so of study in other related sciences; so students planning to go to graduate school
should take courses in the allied sciences and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses will depend on the field in
which a student intends to specialize. Geosciences graduate programs commonly expect entering students to have taken courses in chemistry and mathematics. For those going
into Environmental Geosciences, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering Earth Surface Processes and Life, Biology 102 and Biology
203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
To be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research
culminating in a thesis that demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of
independent research are interest and motivation, mastery of fundamental material and skills, and ability to pursue independent study successfully.

154

STUDY AWAY
Students planning on studying off-campus should meet as early as possible with the Department Chair to plan and to discuss how potential courses might be used in the
Geosciences major. Some study-away programs dovetail well with a geoscience major. Examples include the Williams-Mystic program, and the University of Otago in New
Zealand. Courses offered at Norwegian Technical Universities and at several universities in the United Kingdom have also been accepted as part of the Geosciences major. Most
study-away programs, however, do not usually offer courses that are acceptable substitutes for courses required by the Williams Geosciences major. The Department Chair is
always happy, however, to discuss student plans and ideas for off-campus work.

GEOS 101(F) The Co-Evolution of Earth and Life (Same as ENVI 105)
Our planet is about 4.6 billion years old, and has supported life for at least the last 3.5 billion of those years. This course will consider the inter-related nature of Earth and the life
that inhabits it, starting with the first living organisms and progressing to the interaction of our own species with the Earth today. Students will investigate the dynamic nature of
the Earth-life system, examine many of its feedbacks, and learn about the dramatic changes that have occurred throughout the history of the Earth. We will ask questions such as:
How did the Earth facilitate biologic evolution, and what effects did those biologic events have on the physical Earth? When did photosynthesis evolve, how can we detect that in
the rock record, and how did this biological event lead to profound changes in the environment? How and why did animals evolve and what role did environmental change play
in the radiation of animal life? How did the rise and radiation of land plants affect world climate? How do plate tectonics, glaciation, and volcanism influence biodiversity and
evolutionary innovation? What caused mass extinctions in the past and what can that teach us about our current extinction crisis? Labs will involve hands-on analysis of rocks,
fossils, and real-world data as well as conceptual and analytical exercises; field trips will contextualize major events in Earth history and will help students learn to read the rock
record. Through these investigations, the class will provide a comprehensive overview of Earth history, with special attention paid to the geological and paleontological history of
the northeastern United States.

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs—as expressed by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates—are still strong. In a geological time
frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a message here for all of us who
live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model—one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of the
past century—to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate
interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth’s
interior, the changing configurations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the geological
assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook, a primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the
geology of the Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required all-day field trip on the last Monday of the semester to the Connecticut
Valley and the highlands of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled final exam.

GEOS 103 Global Warming and Natural Disasters (Same as ENVI 103) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The destruction caused by recent hurricanes such as Katrina, devastation of prolonged drought in the African Sahel, catastrophic flooding and mudslides in Indonesia and sea
level encroachment on the Alaska coast are visible examples of natural disasters that may be modulated by climate change. Reports from the World Bank conclude that global
climate change, together with environmental degradation and urbanization, has the potential to increase the severity and impact of natural disasters. In this course we globally
examine geological and climatological processes that “set up” natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, landslides, droughts, extreme temperatures, and coastal surges, as well
as the processes that condition availability of water resources. We study in detail the causes and anticipated consequences of human alteration of climate and its impact on the
spectrum of natural hazards and resources. During laboratory sessions we use local field sites and computer models to analyze recent disasters/hazards and options for mitigating
future impacts and study trends in weather and climate.
Format: lectures, 3 hours per week; laboratory, 2 hours per week. Evaluation based on written reports from laboratories, two hour exams and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected 18). Preference to first- and second-year students.

GEOS 104(S) Oceanography (Same as ENVI 104 and MAST 104)
The oceans covers about 72% of Earth’s surface, yet we know the surface of Venus better than our own ocean floors. Why is that? This integrated introduction to the oceans cover
formation and history of the ocean basins; the composition and origin of seawater; currents, tides, and waves; ocean-atmosphere interactions; oceans and climate; deep-marine
environments; coastal processes; productivity in the oceans; and marine resources. Coastal oceanography will be investigated on an all-day field trip, hosted by the WilliamsMystic program in Connecticut.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory in alternate weeks; one all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, lab work, oral
presentation of an oceanographic topic, participation in the field trip, and a final exam.

GEOS 202(S) Mineralogy and Geochemistry
With a title merging two inter-related fields, this course could be subtitled “An Introduction to Earth Materials and Analytical Techniques.” As the basis for all subsequent
solid-earth courses in the major, it provides a systematic framework for the study of minerals - Earth’s building blocks: their physical and chemical properties at all scales and the
common analytical methods used to identify and interpret them. The course progresses from hand-specimen morphology and crystallography through element distribution and
crystal chemistry to the phase relations, compositional variation, and mineral associations within major rock-forming mineral systems. Laboratory work includes the determination of crystal symmetry; mineral separation; the principles and applications of optical emission spectroscopy; wavelength- and energy-dispersive x-ray spectrochemical analysis; x-ray diffraction; the use of the petrographic microscope; and the identification of important minerals in hand specimen and thin section..
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; independent study of minerals in hand specimen; one afternoon field trip. Evaluation will be based on one
hour test, lab work, and a final exam.

GEOS 205(F) Earth Resources (Same as ENVI 207)
The metal in your soda can, the plastic in your Nalgene, the components of your computer, the glass in your window, the hydrocarbons being burned to keep you warm in the
winter or to transport you in cars or aircraft, the cars and aircraft themselves: all are made of materials mined from the Earth. Right now there are more people building more
houses, paving more roads, making more vehicles, more electronics, and more plastic packaging—all with geologic materials. As demand soars in both established and growing
economies, and as we realize the environmental damage that can result from resource extraction and processing, the importance of understanding Earth’s resources increases.
Finding new deposits and managing those we have requires insight into the geology that underlies the location and origin of strategic Earth materials. This class introduces the
geologic processes that control formation, distribution, and extent of materials reserves: dimension stone and gravel, base and precious metal ores, gemstones, petroleum, nuclear
energy sources, and specialty materials for medical, technological, and military uses.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; one all-day field trip, and a semester project culminating in a poster session. Grading will be based on one hour exam, a final exam,
participation in labs, and the semester project.
Prerequisites: one 100-level GEOS course or permission of instructor; open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).

GEOS 206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus (Same as ENVI 206) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Rising oil and electricity costs disrupt the economy and help fuel global insecurity. Clearer understanding of how fossil-fuel consumption contributes to global climate change is
increasing demand for renewable sources of energy and for more sustainable campus environments. What sources of energy will supply Williams College and nearby areas in the
twenty-first century? How will campus buildings, old and new, continue to be attractive spaces while making far more efficient use of heat and light? How can the College help
support local farms? This course is a practical introduction to renewable sources of energy, including conservation, principles of sustainability, and to their application to the
campus environment. Topics covered include: biological sources of energy (biomass, biogas, liquid fuels), wind energy, geothermal and solar energy, energy efficiency and the
environmental impacts of using renewable energy. Lectures, field trips and individual projects emphasize examples from the campus and nearby area.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on an hour exam, class participation that includes a seminar presentation, and a research project that investigates
some aspect of campus energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions.
Enrollment limit 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to sophomores.

GEOS 212(S) Paleobiology (Same as BIOL 211)
The fossil record is a direct window into the history of life on Earth and contains a wealth of information on evolution, biodiversity, and climate change. This course investigates
the record of ancient life forms, from single–celled algae to snails to dinosaurs. In addition to the intellectual discovery of fossils as organic relics and the ways in which fossils
have been used to support conflicting views on nature, geologic time, and evolution, we will cover a range of topics central to modern paleobiology. These include: how the fossil
record informs our understanding of evolutionary processes including speciation; the causes and consequences of mass extinctions; how fossils help us tell time and reconstruct
the Earth’s climactic and tectonic history; statistical analysis of the fossil record to reconstruct biodiversity through time; analysis of fossil morphology to recreate the biomechanics of extinct organisms; and using fossil communities to reconstruct past ecosystems. Laboratory exercises will take advantage of Williams’ superb fossil collections as well as
published datasets to provide a broad understanding of fossils and the methods we use to study the history of life on Earth. We will also view a diversity of fossils in their geologic
and paleo–environmental context on our field trip to Eastern New York.
Format: lecture/laboratory; field trip to the Paleozoic of New York State. Evaluation will be based on lab assignments, short quizzes and writing assignments, and a final exam.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as ENVI 214)
This class provides a practical look at fast-evolving methods used to integrate information about the Earth’s surface with spatial data collected by disciplines such as archaeology,
economics, the field sciences, history and political science. Remote sensing involves collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield environmental
information about the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing allows regional mapping of rock materials, analysis of vegetation cover and measurement of urban
areas and land-use change over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers concepts of
remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as principles of remote sensing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, and image classification. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, logical overlays and techniques of spatial analysis. Weekly labs focus on training in the application of techniques using data from the region and other areas of North America.
Class format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly lab exercises, an hour exam, and a final project.
Prerequisites: at least one introductory course in BIOL, ENVI, or GEOS. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

GEOS 215(S) Climate Changes (Same as ENVI 215) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth’s climate and its variability. This interest reflects both concern over future climate changes
resulting from anthropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic impact of “natural” climate variability (for example, El Niño
events), especially in the developing world. Efforts to understand the Earth’s climate system and predict future climate changes require both study of parameters controlling
present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In this course, we will review the processes that control the Earth’s climate, like insolation, the greenhouse
effect, ocean circulation, configuration of continents, and positive and negative feedbacks . At the same time, we will review the geological record of climate changes in the past,
examining their causes
Laboratory exercises and problem sets will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quantitative analyses to assess if a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include developing and applying numerical models of the radiative balance of earth and the carbon cycle.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; one three-hour lab every other week. Evaluation will be based on lab exercises and problem sets (25%), three hour exams (50%), and a
final project (25%) where students will collect, analyze, and interpret data.
Prerequisites: 100-level course in GEOS, CHEM, or PHYS or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference to Geoscience majors.

GEOS 217T(F) Planets and Moons (Same as ASTR 217T) (W)
We live in a solar system full of wonders. Each planet and each moon is strange: different from our Earth, and different from each other. The recent flood of images and data from
Mars constantly reveals new marvels—the rest of the solar system is even stranger. The U.S. put men on the moon; there are robots on Mars; and the Soviet Union landed several
times on Venus. The other worlds are known only from flybys and remote images, but it’s amazing how much those can teach us. By focusing on recent research, we will
examine how the solar system works and delve into its mysteries. Topics may include the possible Late Heavy Bombardment of the moon, runaway greenhouse on Venus, water
on Mars, hidden oceans on Europa, and the methane weather cycle on Titan.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 1500-word papers, discussion, and critical analysis. There will be a strong focus on polished writing and argument, and papers
will be thoroughly edited by the professor for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive papers the editorial comments they
receive, and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.

GEOS 218T(F) The Carbon Cycle and Climate (Same as ENVI 218T) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding carbon to the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half of the carbon
we emit each year remains in the atmosphere because biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean, to land plants
and soils, and to sediments. The workings of the carbon cycle are at the center of many controversies surrounding the causes of past climate changes and the outcome of future
global warming. How was the Earth’s climate steered by past changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years ago? Will natural processes continue to take up such a
high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate changes? Can and should we coax natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon
emissions be reduced on the scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through readings of current journal articles and reports.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: The class will meet weekly for a one-hour orientation to the topic, and students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each
student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student’s effectiveness as
a critic.
Prerequisites: one introductory course in CHEM, PHYS or GEOS; not open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth’s crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many
scales ranging from individual mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field
techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a
final exam. Many of the laboratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common problems in structural geology.

GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
Using plate tectonics and the geologic assembly of New England as a template, this course explores the origin of crystalline rocks - volcanic, plutonic, and metamorphic - that
comprise 94% of the Earth’s crust and record most of its history. Field and lab studies (the crux of the course) are backed up by phase-rule applications and fundamental thermodynamic principles. Chemical and mineralogical compositions and rock fabrics provide evidence for crystallization or re-crystallization processes and environments, particularly
as they define present or past plate boundaries or tectonic settings. Lab work emphasizes thin section analysis, with a 3-week segment devoted to interpreting the igneous rocks of
New England collected on field trips.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; several field trips including one full day trip to central New Hampshire. Evaluation will be

GEOS 312T(S) Mass Extinctions: Patterns and Processes (W)
Over the last 543 million years of life on Earth, five major mass extinctions have occurred, each dramatically changing the makeup and course of life on our planet. During some
of these events, over 75% of all marine animal species went extinct and groups like the dinosaurs vanished from the planet after over 100 million years of ecological dominance.
This tutorial course will explore the idea of extinction from the evolution of the concept in human thought to current research on the mechanisms and patterns of extinctions
through time. We will examine how to determine when an extinction is “mass” versus “background”, and delve into the causes and consequences of the major mass extinction
events of the Phanerozoic, including tackling the potential human- induced extinction event occurring in the present day. Over spring break, we will travel to Italy to explore the
geological boundaries of the two largest mass extinctions: the Permian-Triassic (believed to be the largest extinction ever), exposed in the Dolomite mountains of Northern Italy,
and the Cretaceous-Paleogene (where the dinosaurs and many other groups went extinct), exposed in the hills of Umbria. This trip will allow us to combine field observations
with tutorial readings to fully synthesize the causes and consequences of major mass extinctions through time.
Format:tutorial. Evaluation will be based on 4 (4-5-page) papers, tutorial presentations, the student’s effectiveness as a critic, 2 problem sets, and a field trip project.

GEOS 401(F) Global Tectonics and the Rise of Mountains
Fifty years after the sea-floor spreading hypothesis was first verified using magnetic anomalies, we have spectacular data sets from paleomagnetism, seismology, volcanism,
the Global Positioning System, and digital elevation models that provide rich details into the kinematics and mechanisms of present and past plate motions. After an introduction to the theory of plate tectonics, we will learn how to 1) access these data sets, 2) portray them on Google Earth and other geographic information systems, and 3) use them
to test important tectonic models. We will also explore ways in which tectonics, climate, and erosion affect each other during the evolution of mountain ranges.
Class meetings will include lectures and discussions of assigned reading. Labs will include field trips and computer-based projects using large data sets.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation during seminar discussions, weekly 2-page written summaries of journal articles, and four lab reports.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102
stresses communicative competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice in reading and conversation.
German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. German 111-112 offers an alternative introduction to German with a focus on reading competence.
German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines advanced language study with the examination of topics in Germanspeaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the placement test given during First Days in September to determine which course to
take.

STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester or year studying in Germany or Austria, either independently or in one
of several approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs sponsored by American institutions.
Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all students considering study-abroad should
discuss their language preparation with a member of the department.

LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with
the major achievements in German literary and intellectual history.

ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year
and is recommended as preparation for upper-level courses.

THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student’s educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in German. It requires seven courses—three fewer than the major—and is
especially appropriate for students who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of

GERM 202(S) Seh’n Se, det is Berlin
In the history of Germany, Berlin has always been a very important cultural and political center: it was successively the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire,
the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, and the German Democratic Republic, before becoming the capital of a reunited Federal Republic of Germany in 1990. In order to
understand the fascination held by this metropolis before and after WWII and its increasing popularity today, it is crucial to gain an insight into the cultural and historical aspects
of the capital of Germany throughout the 20th century. In order to do so, we will read texts by Erich Kästner, Kurt Tucholsky, Thomas Brussig, and Wladimir Kaminer, look at
paintings by Ernst Ludwig Kirschner, Otto Dix and photographs by August Sander, watch movies by Fritz lang, Wolfgang Staudte, Hannes Stöhr, and Detlev Buck, and listen to
cabaret songs by Marlene Dietrich and electronic music by Ellen Alien. Conducted in German.

GERM 202 Vienna 1900-2000 and Beyond (Same as INST 202) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Once the center of a vast empire, Austria has tended to be overlooked since the demise of that empire. In fact, though, its trajectory can usefully serve as a guide to the complex
developments in Europe before, during, and after the Second World War. Contemporary Austria is indeed a laboratory of post-Cold War Europe: Its population is remarkably
multicultural, in spite of resistances; its language is rich and dynamic, yet increasingly dominated by its more powerful neighbor to the north; its political attitudes encompass
extreme nationalism, pan-Europeanism, and much in between. Austria’s capital, Vienna, will form the lens through which we examine the origins and quirks of this fascinating,
sometimes paradoxical, culture. The course will employ a variety of written, video, audio, and cyber-materials to explore some of the issues facing contemporary Austria, and to
continue the development of advanced reading, writing, and speaking skills begun in German 201. Conducted in German.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: active class participation, several 1- to 2-page writing assignments, final written/oral project.
Prerequisite: GERM 201 or the equivalent. Enrollment Limit: 16 (expected: 8). Preference given to German majors.

GERM 202 Berlin—Multicultural Metropolis Between East and West (Not offered 2013-2014)
We will examine texts and films about Berlin as a center of cultural and social transformations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with special emphasis on the
post-wall period. We will move from the turn of the century (when the city’s population had recently tripled in size) to the establishing of Berlin as a world capital in the 1920s,
then through Nazi-era transformations, wartime destruction and the cold war division of the city. We will conclude with the reshaping of the city after the fall of the Berlin wall.
Texts and films may include: Walter Benjamin, Berliner Kindheit um 1900, excerpts from Ulrich van der Heyden und Joachim Zeller’s Kolonialmetropole Berlin, Walter Ruttmann, Sinfonie einer Großstadt, Irmgard Keun’s Das kunstseidene Mädchen, Nazi architect Albert Speer’s plans for Berlin as the fascist capital “Germania,” the 1956 East

GERM 277 Dangerous Minds/Endangered Minds in the German Tradition (Same as COMP 277) (Not offered 2013-2014)
“When we are missing ourselves, we are missing everything.” So spoke young Werther in Johann Wolfgang Goethe’s groundbreaking novel from 1774. The Sorrows of Young
Werther exploded into high Enlightenment Germany, with its emphasis on rationality, on universal human values and on optimism about the future, a bestseller that instead
exposed the volatile inner world of an extraordinary individual. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and Austria, profound interiority surfaced frequently to challenge—and even threaten—what was touted as the triumph of objective, scientific thought. At the same time, the writers and thinkers who explored the deepest
recesses of the mind were beset by alienation and despair as they were drawn into inevitable conflict with dominant paradigms.
This course will examine literature and thought at the moments when the tectonic plates of reason and supposed unreason converge and collide most forcefully: around 1800
(Goethe, Kleist, and the Romantics), around 1900 (Nietzsche, Freud, Kafka, Hofmannsthal), the mid-twentieth century with its disastrous consequences (Hitler, Böll, Bachmann) and the end of the millennium (Roth, Jelinek). Some theoretical work (psychoanalytic theory, Adorno, Benjamin) will aid in the process of understanding the literature and
philosophy we read. All readings and discussion will be in English translation.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several one-page papers, one 5-page paper and a final written and oral project.
Prerequisites: one college-level literature course. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference given to actual or prospective Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, or
German majors.

GERM 306T Enlightenment and its Discontents (Same as COMP 314T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
“Sapere Aude,” declared Immanuel Kant in his essay “What is Enlightenment?“ (1784): “Have the courage to make use of your own capacity to reason.” Kant’s exhortation
sums up the mood of the high Enlightenment, a trend in Western thought that gave birth to most of the ideals that we still hold dear: the primacy and universality of reason, the
autonomy of the individual, the educative and restorative powers of the nuclear family. Today we are confronted daily with the tensions and gaps hidden inside Enlightenment
thinking; in fact, the fissures in the edifice of the Enlightenment were subtly present from the beginning. This course will trace the development of Enlightenment assumptions
through German literature and theory. Our reading will move through several stations of the development of Enlightenment thinking, from its most fervent proponents (Kant,
Lessing), through those who put it to a severe test (Kleist, Hoffmann, Büchner), to the outright subversion of its premises (Nietzsche, Freud, Kafka). Readings and discussion in
German for those who know German, in English for those who do not.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5-page papers or 2-page written commentaries every other week.
Prerequisites: for German students, 201 or the equivalent; for non-German students, one college literature course; not open to first-year students, except with permission of the

GERM 310T Storm and Stress and More (Same as COMP 310T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The first half of the course will focus on the Sturm-und-Drang movement (1770-1785) that launched the literary careers of Goethe and Schiller; the second half will map the
lasting influence of the movement’s extremist aesthetic by considering a variety of works by authors, artists and filmmakers of the 19th and 20th centuries. We’ll deal with themes
like forbidden love, suicide, crime, war and revolution and with formal tendencies like poetic egotism, social realism, and radical expressionism. We’ll read plays, poems,
manifestos and stories by Goethe, Klinger and Schiller, and then move on to texts by Büchner, Nietzsche, Hauptmann, Wedekind, Kafka and Benn, paintings by Marc, SchmidtRottluff, Lohse-Wächtler and Kirchner, and films by Murnau, Lang and Herzog. All materials in German for those who take the course as GERM 310T; all materials in English

GERM 316T “Wer ist wir?”: Recent Debates over Multiculture in Germany (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
German chancellor Angela Merkel controversially claimed in 2010: “Multikulti ist gescheitert.” (Multiculturalism has failed in Germany). We will investigate different perspectives on Germany’s integration of minorities. In the 1960s, government labor contracts brought large numbers of foreign workers into the country and facilitated the “economic
miracle.” How did the newcomers adapt to life in Germany and what did they hold on to from their home cultures? How did subsequent generations experience life in Germany?
What were the major political shifts that took place regarding citizenship and participation in the public sphere? How do popular media portray minorities? How do members of
minority groups portray themselves?
We will read texts by: Zafer Senocak, Hatice Akyün, Yoko Tawada, Marica Bodrozic, Navid Kermani, Wladimir Kaminer, view feature films and documentaries, and discuss a
wide range of social commentary and analyses across the political spectrum from right wing populists to left liberals: Thilo Sarrazin, Kirsten Heisig, Astrid Geisler and Christoph
Schultheis, Wilhelm Heitmeyer, Alexander Häusler, Freya Klier, Mark Terkessidids, Rita Süssmuth and others.

GERM 321T(F) Lust, Liebe und Gewalt (W)
In the finale of Salome, an opera in German by Richard Strauss, a young Salome kisses the severed head of John the Baptist, while expressing her desire and declaring her love to
him. No other opera makes the violence of love and lust more explicit; it brings the interplay of Eros and Thanatos to a climax. In this course, we will reflect on the intimate
relationship between love, lust, and violence, examining how love and lust do not exclude violence, but rather include—if not provoke—it. In order to gain a better understanding
of the dynamics formed by this fascinating triangle, we will read a collection of short stories by Bernhard Schlink, plays by Arthur Schnitzler and Frank Wedekind, poems by
Johann Wolfgang Goethe, look at paintings by Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka, watch movies by Josef von Sternberg and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and listen to pop songs
by Nina Hagen and Rammstein. Conducted in German.

GERM 323T(S) Reason, Unreason and Anti-Reason from the Enlightenment to the Third Reich (Same as COMP 323T) (W)
From its inception in the eighteenth century, modern German art and thought have probed the nature of human reason. At every turn, the celebration of rationality as triumphing
over the irrational has brought with it a resistance to the rational: Lessing’s Enlightenment dramas find their counterpart in those of the Sturm und Drang movement; Kleist’s
preoccupation with reliable justice and predictable happiness can’t hide an unblinking knowledge of life’s randomness; Freud’s search for ultimate knowledge is constantly
shadowed by the unknowable; in the acts and “theories” of the Nazis, we see the ultimate horror of rationality reduced to rigid mechanics, in the service of the unthinkable. The
course will involve reading closely and writing intensively about texts by, among others, Lessing, Goethe, Kleist, Büchner, Nietzsche, Freud, Kafka, and the Nazi propagandists.
Offered in English or German: Reading, discussion and writing will be in German for German-speakers, in English for non-German speakers.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The History department seeks to cultivate a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the development of our students’ intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical
abilities. In pursuit of the first objective, through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity, and complexities of human history
over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the same time, the department
endeavors to develop students’ ability to think historically and to foster in them an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them
with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the
nature and uses of historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their ability to formulate historically informed
analyses and their analytical and rhetorical skills.

COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are
distinguished less by degree of difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge they presume.

First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity to explore an exciting historical topic in-depth, learn about
the discipline of history, and improve their research and writing skills. Because these courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the advanced study of
History, they are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources,
formulating a research question and developing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of reading skills (such
as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make). These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and
include varied assignments that stress the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style. Enrollment preference in
100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sophomores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the arguments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and present five or six oral
critiques of another student’s work. First-year students and sophomores will normally be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of each type may count toward the History major; these
courses can also be used to meet the department’s group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries,
and geographic regions over relatively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study in history at
the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the individual course.
Major Seminars (301): Major seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History
majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself—on the debates over how to approach the past, on
questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology,
and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the
project of studying the past? Each year several major seminars will be offered. Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Major
Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year (space permitting), and those planning to be away for the whole of their junior year are encouraged to do so.
Advanced Electives (302-396): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to
follow such courses. Enrollment is often limited. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that students
enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will
require students to engage in research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar
(402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Preference is given to senior History majors, followed by
junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to
ten students and preference is given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492).
Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student’s
essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:

ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the department
about the History major.
All incoming majors will choose a faculty advisor in the spring of their sophomore year. All majors must meet with their advisor in the beginning of the fall semester, to
develop their Concentration (see below), and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved.
Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact the faculty director of the Honors Program. Prospective study abroad students should
contact the department’s administrative assistant.

THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:

Required Courses in the Major
One Major Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one to be chosen from among three of the following groups:
Group A: The History of Africa
Group B: The History of Asia
Group C: The History of Europe and Russia
Group D: The History of Latin America and the Caribbean
Group E: The History of the Middle East
Group F: The History of the United States and Canada
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group G in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the
group requirement (Groups A-F).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through F.

Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. Students are responsible for designing their own concentration, in consultation with a faculty
advisor, in the fall semester of their Junior year. Each student’s concentration will be formally approved by the Department’s Curriculum Committee. A concentration will consist
of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period; only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level
course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In the Concentration Proposal, the student must list a minimum total of six courses that could
satisfy the requirements of the concentration, from which they can select three to fulfill the concentration requirement (recognizing that not all courses are offered every year);
courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of the chair.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to
undertake independent research or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and seminar.
Application to enter the thesis program is made by spring registration in the junior year and is based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining
at least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write a thesis submit a proposal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away
during the spring semester of their junior year make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the student to secure the agreement of a member of
the department to act as his or her thesis advisor, normally a faculty member with whom the student has worked in the past. The student therefore consults with a member of the
department about a thesis topic and secures the faculty member’s agreement to serve as his or her thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. The thesis
proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic is related to course work that the student has completed. Students should be aware
that, while the department tries to accommodate all students who qualify to write a thesis, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible. Final admission to the thesis program
depends on the department’s assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the thesis program, he or she registers for History 493, Senior Thesis Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031 during
winter study, and for History 494, Senior Thesis Seminar, in the spring. In addition to researching and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students attend special
presentations under the History Department’s Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advisors. Throughout the semester, thesis writers also present progress reports for
group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar is taken into consideration in determining students’ continued participation in the thesis program and is
taken into account in determining their final thesis grades calculated at the end of the year. Students are required to submit one draft thesis chapter to their advisor and the director
of the thesis seminar by the end of the fall semester. During the first week of winter study students present their draft chapter to the thesis seminar and members of the history
department thesis committee. Students deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point are allowed to continue with the thesis. They devote
the entire winter study period to thesis work. They normally conclude their research during winter study and must complete a second draft chapter of their thesis for submission to
their advisor and the director of the thesis seminar before the end of winter study. By the beginning of spring semester, the thesis committee formally consults with advisors and
makes a recommendation to the department on which students are allowed to proceed with the thesis. Those students continuing with the thesis present a draft chapter of their
thesis to the thesis seminar and members of the department’s thesis committee during the early weeks of the second semester.
Completed theses are due in mid-April, after which each student prepares and makes a short oral presentation of his or her thesis at the departmental Thesis Colloquium. Another
student who has read the thesis then offers a critique of the thesis, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis offer their own comments and questions, followed by a general
discussion of the thesis by students and other members of the department.

LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll
in language courses at Williams.

STUDY ABROAD
The History Department considers immersion in and familiarity with a foreign culture not only to be valuable in themselves, but also to provide an important way of understanding the past. Students who major in History therefore are encouraged to study a foreign language and to consider studying abroad during their junior year. History courses
taken as part of a study abroad program that is recognized by the college normally can be used to satisfy departmental distribution and general requirements, up to a maximum of
three courses (this limit does not apply to tutorials taken as part of the Williams-Exeter Program; no courses taken abroad, even at Oxford, can be used to satisfy the major seminar
and advanced seminar/tutorial requirements). Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Major Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore
year, and those planning to be away the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
Students interested in studying abroad during their junior year should discuss their plans with a member of the department as well as with the department’s administrative
assistant. Approval of departmental credit for courses taken abroad normally must be obtained from the chair or from the administrative assistant prior to the commencement of
the study abroad program.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (102-111)
HIST 104 Travel Narratives and African History (Same as AFR 104) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In a way, all historical thinking and writing deals with travel accounts given that, as many scholars have noted, the past can be likened to a foreign country and the historian can be
viewed as a traveler in foreign places. Nevertheless, actual travel narratives-narratives about the physical visits of writers to distant lands-call for careful and critical analysis
because they can be seductive, and they can shape the ways we think about the present-and the past-of distant lands and cultures. This course discusses Arab, Indian, European,

161

African, and African American travel narratives about various regions of Africa since the fourteenth century. We will mine the travel accounts for descriptions of local contexts.
We will also explore what travel writing says about the author’s perceptions of self, home, and “other.” Ultimately, we will investigate the authors’ biases and how the narratives
influence both our perception of Africa and the writing of African history. This course is highly interdisciplinary and draws heavily on literary, anthropological, geographical, and
historical methodologies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1-2 short papers, and a research paper.
No prerequisites; first-year or sophomore standing; juniors or seniors with permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to
first-year students, and then sophomores who have not previously taken a 100-level seminar.

HIST 105(F) How to Save Africa (Same as AFR 105 and INST 105) (W)
How to save Africa? This course will not provide an easy answer to that question. Instead, we will study how and why that query has become ubiquitous and legitimate in the first
place. Salvation projects have been numerous in African history: the antislavery campaigns; the so–called civilizing mission; structural adjustment programs; and, more recently,
humanitarian campaigns like “Save Darfur” and “Kony 2012.” We will use recent scholarship to discuss different points of views on these projects. We will also closely read a set
of primary sources—memoirs, newspaper articles, and films on the “salvation complex” in Africa—and we will subject them to similar questions: what did Africa need to be
delivered from? Who were the agents of redemption? What were the effects of the salvation projects? How did Africans react to them? Finally, we will examine the changes and
continuities between the different projects of salvation, and consider how the study of history might help us understand Africa’s position in the world today.

HIST 115(S) The World of the Mongol Empire (Same as ASST 115) (W)
By the middle of the thirteenth century, Mongol armies led by Genghis Khan had conquered an enormous swath of territory, extending from China westward to Eastern Europe.
Further expanded by Genghis’s descendants, the Mongol Empire incorporated a vast range of different peoples and cultures, enhancing communications, trade, and exchange
among them. In this course we will examine the “world order” of the Mongol Empire from its origins on the Asian steppe through its expansion, consolidation, disintegration,
and legacies for later periods. From a wide range of primary and secondary sources, including travelers’ accounts, chronicles, art, and literature, we will investigate the diverse
experiences of the Mongol world in different places, such as China, Russia, Persia, and Central Asia.

HIST 117(S) Bombay/Mumbai: Making of a Modern Metropolis (Same as ASST 117 and INST 117) (W)
In the summer of 1661, a marriage alliance between the Portuguese and the British crowns resulted in the hand over of a set of seven small, swampy, spottily inhabited islands on
the west coast of India to the latter. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, these islands, turned into a contiguous landmass by the British, emerged as the thriving port
city of Bombay. Known today as Mumbai, it is the heart of India’s commercial life comparable in vibrancy and multiculturalism with the world’s foremost cities like New York
and Shanghai. Yet, Mumbai also has its own unique character. In fact it is often said that Mumbai is not just a city but also a state of mind. Its vibrant culture and dark underbelly
of poverty and violence have inspired numerous books and films. In this course we will explore the many narratives about Mumbai, from colonial to contemporary times to
understand how this city of dreams has been imagined throughout its history. These narratives will be placed alongside recent research on the specific themes in order to understand the different elements that went into the making of this modern metropolis.

HIST 119 The Japanese Empire (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The largest non-Western empire of modern times, Japan extended its reach to Taiwan, Korea, China, Sakhalin, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific. This course explores the
many contentious political, economic, social, and cultural questions that arise from Japan’s imperial project. We will ask what drove imperialist expansion; how the Japanese
ruled; who won and lost in economic relations; what various aspects of life were like in the empire; how to understand the dynamics between Japanese settlers and the colonized;
what effects empire building had at home in Japan; how to explain the nature of wartime conquests; and what legacies Japanese imperialism and empire left in their wake.
Throughout the semester, we will make a point of examining these issues from various standpoints, and we will also read theoretical works that place the Japanese empire in a
comparative context. Course materials will include political documents, intellectual treatises, films, memoirs, and literature.

HIST 121T The Two Koreas (Same as ASST 121T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The two Koreas–-North and South–-were born in the aftermath of World War II, when the United States and the Soviet Union arbitrarily divided the peninsula into two zones of
occupation at the 38th parallel. Today, over six decades later, the split endures as what has been called “the Cold War’s last divide.” This tutorial examines the history of the two
Koreas from their creation in 1945 to the present. We will explore the historical and ideological origins of the division; how tensions between North and South led to the outbreak
of the Korean War; why the paths of the two Koreas have differed so markedly; how each country has been shaped by its political leaders and their ideologies; and what recent
developments in North Korea, including its nuclear program, have meant for relations on the peninsula and beyond. Course material will include primary and secondary sources
of various kinds, including political documents, intellectual treatises, films, and short stories.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay every other

HIST 127 The Expansion of Europe (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the world from the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century—the early
period of European Imperialism. Specific topics will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and Renaissance Europe, the discovery and conquest of
the New World, the struggle with Islam for command of the seas, the establishment of European influence in the East and Far East, the slave trade, the invasion of North America,
and the initial steps toward hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Students will investigate the ways in which individual personality, religiosity, greed, critical first contacts,
and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important aspects of the Military, Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a
world-wide scale during this early period of European Imperialism.

HIST 129(S) Blacks, Jews, and Women in the Age of the French Revolution (Same as WGSS 129) (D) (W)
The French Revolution was an important turning point in world history. Besides ushering in an age of liberté (liberty) and égalité (equality), it also postulated the existence of a
new revolutionary fraternité (brotherhood) between peoples of all backgrounds. Would revolutionary fraternity include women, African slaves, and Jews in the new democratic
polity? French men and women debated these questions in ways that have had a direct impact on our contemporary discussions of race, gender, religious freedom and ethnicity.
In this course, we will explore these debates, their Enlightenment roots, and the legacy of these debates for France’s minorities today. Students will be introduced to various types
of historical sources (rare books, art, opera, plays), as well as to the lively historiographical debates between historians of France concerning methodology, politics, and the goal
of historical research.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1-2 short papers, a 15- to 20-page research paper, and a final examination (may be an oral and/or

HIST 130(F) The First Crusade (W)
Between 1096 and 1099, thousands of peasants, soldiers and nobles set out to seize Jerusalem from the Turks. Their unprecedented military expedition, which ushered in a long
series of religious wars and has deeply influenced modern impressions of the Middle Ages, is known to history as the First Crusade. In this seminar, we will follow the crusaders
through medieval chronicles and histories as they respond to ecclesiastical demands for military intervention in the East, travel to Constantinople, lay siege to Nicaea and Antioch, and finally capture Jerusalem. Along the way we will pause frequently to study the broader social, religious and political environment that gave birth to the crusading
movement. Careful reading and discussion will drive this writing-intensive course.

HIST 135T(F) The Great War, 1914-1918 (Same as LEAD 135T) (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created the modern world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture
dominated the globe. After a century of general peace the continual “progress” of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then, in August, 1914, the major European powers went
to war with one another. After four years of unprecedented carnage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous optimism replaced by pessimism,
its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and who was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the
very end, indecisive? Why did the Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement settle? How was Europe changed? What is the
historical significance of the conflict?

HIST 136 Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile nations that had only just put an end to the carnage of World War I. Paris
was the grande dame; Berlin the upstart. In the 1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural movements that would leave a lasting imprint on
European society until the present day. This course focuses on the politics, society, and culture of these two cities in their heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider their fate in
the 1930s, first as depression set in, and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the semester to Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will examine a range of parallel topics
in both contexts, including the impact of World War I, the growing popularity of right-wing political movements and the increase in political violence, shifting gender norms and
sexual mores, and new developments in the realms of art, film, theatre, cabaret, and literature.

HIST 140T(S) Fin-de-Siècle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay (W)
Imperial Russia on the eve of the First World War presents a complex picture of political conflict, social and economic change, and cultural ferment and innovation. Newly
emergent political parties sought to enlist mass support to transform or overthrow the tsarist regime, which in turn endeavored to preserve itself through a combination of repression, reform, and the refashioning of its image. Rapid urbanization and industrialization, and the spread of education and literacy, gave rise to social conflict and dislocation,
demands for social reform, and the redefinition of individual identities and beliefs. These political, social, cultural, and economic developments provided a fertile context for the
burst of literary creativity and the emergence of modernist literary and artistic movements that occurred in fin-de-siècle imperial Russia. Through a variety of primary and
secondary sources, this course will explore the interrelationship in late imperial Russia between political, social, and cultural change and conflict on the one hand and literary and
artistic creativity on the other. Our goal will be to gain an understanding of both the pressures that contributed to the Revolutions of 1917 and the reasons why this proved to be
such a culturally creative period.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: in alternative weeks, students will write an essay based on class readings and critique their tutorial partner’s essay.

HIST 141 Adventures and Pleasures in the Russian Metropolis, 1880-1917 (Same as WGSS 141) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course introduces students to the artistic movements, everyday life, and socio-cultural upheavals of urban Russia in the fin-de-siècle (1880 to 1917). The fast-paced, consumer-oriented modern city, with its celebrities, fashions, and technological wonders, gripped the imagination of imperial Russia’s urban denizens. The inhabitants of St. Petersburg and Moscow, conscious of living in a new era, embraced and grappled with the Modern Age as journalists, impresarios, and artists narrated and interpreted it. We will
explore the ways revolution and war, industrialization, the commercialization of culture, and new sensibilities about the self and identity were reflected in modernist art and
thought, literature, and autobiographical writings. We also will look closely at the realms of elite entertainment and popular amusement in an attempt to relate consumer culture to
notions of gender and sexuality, the redefinition of status and privilege, and concepts of leisure. Historians have offered competing explanations of how and why the rapid social,
economic and cultural changes of this period contributed to the fall of the Russian monarchy and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Our primary goal will be to use sources to
assess their arguments and, hopefully, make our own. Texts include: historical scholarship, literary works, philosophical and sociological writings, music, visual art, and film.

HIST 143 Soccer and History in Latin America: Making the Beautiful Game (Not offered 2013-2014) (W) (D)
This course examines the rise of soccer (fútbol/futebol) in modern Latin America, from a fringe game to the most popular sport in the region. Focusing especially on Brazil,
Argentina, Peru, and Mexico, we will analyze the central role that soccer played as these countries faced profound questions about race, masculinity, and regional and national
identities. Using autobiographies, videos, and scholarly works from several disciplines, we will consider topics including: the role of race and gender constructions in the initial
adoption of soccer; the transformation of this foreign game into a key marker of national identity; the relationship between soccer and political and economic “modernization”;
the production of strong, at times violent identities at club, national, and regional levels; and the changes that mass consumerism and globalization have effected on the game and
its meanings for Latin Americans. As an Exploring Diversity Initiative course, the class uses primary sources as well as recent scholarship to explore these issues comparatively
between regions and nations. Throughout the semester, we will look at how the world of soccer reflects, produces, and at times apparently resolves cultural difference.

For more than a century, the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has served as the principal touchstone for legal debates over the meaning of equality and freedom in the
United States. This course explores the origins of the 14th Amendment in the years immediately following the Civil War, and examines the evolution of that amendment’s
meaning in the century that followed. Central themes in this course include the contested interpretations of “due process,” “privileges and immunities,” “equal protection,” and
“life, liberty or property”; the rise, fall, and rebirth of substantive due process; and the battles over incorporating the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment. We will pay
particular attention to how debates over the 14th Amendment have shaped and been shaped by the changing meanings of racial and gender equality, and how the 14th Amendment has transformed the promise and experience of American citizenship.

HIST 154T(S) The American Way of War: The First Three Centuries (W)
Is there an historically distinct American way of war? How have Americans experienced warfare? From the earliest days of European settlement through the final campaigns
against American Indians west of the Mississippi, Americans have often been at war. Long before the United States became a world power those conflicts had determined many
of the basic contours of American society, culture, and nationhood. This tutorial will investigate the nature and development of American wars over the period 1600 to 1900.
Though some attention will be paid to the American Revolution and the Civil War, the tutorial will concentrate primarily on lesser known but still historically significant wars,
including King Philip’s War, the Seven Years War, the War of 1812, Jackson’s Indian Wars, the Mexican-American War, the Plains Indians Wars, and the Spanish American War.
All but the last were fought to conclusion in North America itself. How did Americans fight these wars? How did American militaries establish control over such a huge and
varied continent? What role did military institutions play in the development of a distinctive American society? Did war abet social mobility, or lend itself to social control? What
role did race play in the creation and sustaining of martial goals? What was the relationship between local military institutions and centralist attempts to create a national and/or
professional army? What was the impact of warfare on American culture, on concepts of masculinity, and national or community images? Despite the fact that Americans have
often conceived of themselves as a peace-loving people, war from the beginning has played a key role in shaping their society and nation. It is exactly the nature, meaning, and
paradoxes of American wars that this tutorial will attempt to unravel.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 7-page essay every other week on the readings
assigned for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner.

HIST 157(S) From Powhatan to Lincoln: Discovering Leadership in a New World (Same as AMST 157 and LEAD 157) (W)
The collision of cultures and peoples in colonial North America created a New World that demanded new forms of political leadership. This course explores the history of
leadership from the colonial era to the Civil War through the study of consequential individuals whose actions shaped seminal moments in American history. As often as possible,
the course will analyze rival leaders to understand the many different forms of leadership that existed throughout American history and how historical contexts affected individual
decisions. The course opens with Powhatan, whose Native American empire spanned the East Coast of North America, and John Smith, who confronted this Indian empire as he
tried to establish England’s first toehold in the New World, and ends with Abraham Lincoln, who tried to keep together a nation that Jefferson Davis aimed to destroy. In between,
the course will explore colonial leaders like John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. African American leaders like Gabriel Prosser, who led a slave
rebellion, and Richard Allen, a free black abolitionist; presidents like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; First ladies like Abigail Adams and Dolley Madison; advocates
for women’s rights like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, and others. Providing a survey of early American history through the study of these individuals, students
will have a deeper appreciation of how historical processes shaped leaders—and how leaders have shaped history.

Slavery and freedom rose as concomitant ideologies—simultaneously and interrelated—critical to the development of the American colonies and United States. Few areas of
American social, political, and economic history have been more active and exciting in recent years than the study of this relationship. This seminar introduces students to the
most important aspects of American slavery, beginning with an examination of the international slave trade and traces the development of the “peculiar institution” to its demise
with the Civil War.
Format: seminar. In addition to reading key books in the field, students will engage in primary source research using the College library’s extensive holdings of microfilm and
local records dealing with slavery in the North and the South. Building on several preliminary essays, each student will complete a research project which leads to a final research

Ever since the Manhattan Project produced atomic weapons for Harry Truman to use against Japan at the end of World War II, atomic science has fueled Americans’ fears, hopes,
nightmares, and fantasies. This course will examine all aspects of American nuclear culture, from scientists’ movements to abolish atomic weapons and expand peaceful atomic
energy production to dystopian fiction about the nuclear apocalypse. It will investigate the role of the nuclear arms race in the cold war and the development of civil defense and
bomb shelter culture in the United States. Using scholarly books and articles, primary sources, novels, and films, we will explore the interactions between science, diplomacy,
and culture in the nuclear age. In this writing-intensive course, we will focus on analyzing sources, writing clearly and effectively, and making persuasive arguments. Students
will not only learn about history, but they will learn to think and write as historians.

HIST 166(S) Politics and Prose: Invisible Man in Historical Context (Same as AFR 166 and AMST 166) (D) (W)
“I am an invisible man.” So begins Ralph Ellison’s treatise on black life in the United States in the middle of the twentieth century. Ellison’s book Invisible Man appeared in 1952,
won the National Book Award, and secured a prominent place in the canons of both American and African American arts and letters. Often studied for its literary crafting and for
the ways it echoes the work of classic American writers, Invisible Man iterates the black past as it affects its protagonist. This course examines the novel and its themes in
historical context: debates among black ideologues and leaders; links between culture and protest; and effects of black migration and urbanization. In addition to the novel the
course also includes readings in black sociology, anthropology, law, literature, political science, education, folklife, and music.

HIST 167(F) Let Freedom Ring: African Americans and Emancipation (Same as AFR 167 and AMST 167) (W)
This course will examine African Americans’ transition from slavery to freedom. In the years that encompassed the Civil War and immediately after, most African Americans
changed from being legal property, able to be bought, sold, mortgaged, rented out, and leveraged into U.S. citizens, with the Constitutional right to male suffrage. This course
examines this transition. How did it come about? To what extent were African Americans able to exercise their rights that the constitution guaranteed? How did Emancipation
shape African American family relations, culture and demography? This is a research seminar. We will examine work of historians and discuss the contradictions and nuances of
emancipation. Readings will include monographs, scholarly articles and heavy dose of primary sources, as many as possible written by African Americans themselves. Assignments include an original research paper on an aspect of Emancipation. We will devote considerable time throughout the semester to finding primary and secondary sources and

HIST 178T Marriage and the American Nation (Same as WGSS 178T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This tutorial explores the transformation of marriage as an institution, idea, and experience from colonial times through the beginning of the twenty-first century. What is marriage? Is it a private agreement or a public contract? A legal bond or a religious sacrament? A right or a privilege? Who can enter it? Who determines when it is over, and on what
grounds? Examining the long history of American debates about these questions, we will consider the complex ways that beliefs and policies regarding marriage have affected
national understandings of gender roles, of racial difference, of the meaning of citizenship, and of the function and reach of government. We will explore many of the controversies associated with marriage over the last 400 years, including interracial marriage, polygamy, divorce, domestic violence, property rights, custody, cohabitation, working mothers, and same-sex marriage.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a classmate; each week, students will alternate between writing a 5- to
7-page paper on the assigned readings (to be presented orally in class) and writing and presenting a 2-page critique of his/her classmate’s paper; the course will conclude with a
final paper that examines one of the issues raised in class in greater depth.
No prerequisites; first-year or sophomore standing; juniors or seniors with permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores, and then to first-year students who have not previously taken a 100-level tutorial.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES (201-299)
These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long
time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or
large formats, depending on the individual course.

HIST 201(F) History Behind the Headlines (Same as AMST 202) (D)
What is the history behind some of the major issues covered by the media? And what are some of the differing perspectives on and interpretations of how to address some of the
most significant issues that face us all? This course will challenge students to think historically about the present by introducing the methods and conceptual tools historians use to
understand the past and how that may lead to a better appreciation of contemporary society. Students will be encouraged to become more critical readers of the media and thus
better assess when and how history is used and abused in the public sphere. Throughout the semester, members of the History Department will visit the class and address how
their field is represented in the media and political discourse. Because of its commitment to explore how people in different societies respond to the pressing issues of the day and
how people in various corners of the world are redefining and rethinking notions of rights, this course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI).
Format: lecture. Requirements: three short papers and one longer final paper.

HIST 204(F) Modern African History (Same as AFR 203)
This course surveys the history of Sub–Saharan African in the 19th and 20th centuries. We will explore the parallel and shared histories of informal imperialism, European
conquest, colonialism, liberation struggles, decolonization, and postcolonial challenges in West, Central, East, and Southern Africa. We will particularly explore Africans’ lived
experiences of these two centuries of history: how have Africans been affected by the different historical processes of the 19th and 20th centuries? And how did they actively
participate in shaping these processes? Course materials will include films, photographs, music, fiction, written primary sources, and recent scholarship.

This survey course introduces some of the most fascinating figures, puzzling problems, and heated debates in Middle Eastern history. We will explore trends in the pre–Islamic
Middle East; traditional and revisionist interpretations of Islamic origins; the expansion of the Islamic polity throughout the Middle East; the great Islamic caliphates based in the
flourishing capitals of Baghdad and Cairo; the disruptive impact of the Crusades, Mongol conquests, and Black Death on the medieval Middle East; and the rise of the Ottoman
Empire. After reading primary and secondary sources, students will be equipped to form their own interpretations of this foundational period in Middle Eastern history.

HIST 206 Muhammad and the Rise of Islam (ARAB 206 and REL 235) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course will trace the historical development of Islam, one of the world’s major religions and multi-cultural traditions, from early in the seventh century until the establishment of the Safavid Empire in 1501. The first part of the course will focus on the life and career of Muhammad, as prophet and statesman, and how he became an ideal for public
and private behavior. The main part will consider the emergence of Islamic scripture, institutions, festivals, theology, and law and how a religion that had its origins in the Arabian
Peninsula developed in multifaceted ways in Asia, Africa, and Europe. One major aim of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and especially to how Muslims have defined
themselves in multiple socio-historical contexts and how that context may have determined their interpretations of the Qur’an and the legacy of the Prophet Muhammad. Because the course explores the myriad reactions to the rise of Islam in different cultural communities, it is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short quizzes and papers, a midterm, and final project.

Middle East, relations with Great Powers, the impact of imperialism, the challenge of modernity, the creation of nation states and nationalist ideologies, the discovery of oil,
radical religious groups, and war and peace. Throughout the course these significant changes will be evaluated in light of their impact on the lives of a variety of individuals in the
region and especially how they have grappled differently with increasing Western political and economic domination. This course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative
because it compares the differences and similarities between different cultures and societies in the Middle East and the various ways they have responded to one another in the
past.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: ASIA (212-221)
HIST 212(S) Transforming the “Middle Kingdom”: China, 2000 BCE-1600 (Same as ASST 212) (D)
China expanded from scattered Neolithic settlements to become one of the world’s most complex and sophisticated civilizations. During this process, it experienced dramatic
transformation as well as remarkable institutional and cultural continuities. This course will examine Chinese history from prehistoric times to the “early modern” seventeenth
century. It will address topics such as the creation and transformation of dynastic authority, the reinterpretation of Confucian thought, the transmission of Buddhism, the conquest
of China proper by “barbarian” peoples, the composition of elites, and change in daily life, popular culture and China’s place in the East Asian and world systems. This course
fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement in that it disputes the idea of a single, stable Chinese identity throughout history, and focuses instead on the variety of
cultures and cultural encounters that contributed to what we currently think of as “Chinese” history and culture.

Observers may be struck by the apparent contradictions of contemporary China: market reforms undertaken by a nominally Communist government, extremes of urban wealth
and rural poverty, increasing participation in the international community and intensifying nationalist rhetoric. This course will examine China’s historical engagement with the
modern world in order to gain perspective on our current views. It will cover the Qing (1644-1911) dynastic order, encounters with Western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of
Chinese nationalism, Republican and Communist revolutions, the “other Chinas” of Taiwan and Hong Kong, economic liberalization, and globalization. This course is part of
the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that it requires students to engage with questions of difference through studying the development of the modern Chinese nation-state from the
multi-ethnic empire of the Qing and China’s particular experiences of imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

HIST 217 Early Modern Japan (Same as ASST 217 and JAPN 217) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The ascension of powerful warlords in the late 1500s brought to an end a century of constant warfare and laid the foundation for the Tokugawa bakufu, the military government
headed by the Tokugawa shogun that would rule Japan for almost three hundred years. This course will introduce students to the extraordinary changes of the years between the
establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its collapse in 1868, an era characterized by relative peace and stability, periods of economic growth as well as stagnation, the
growth of cities and towns, the flourishing of urban culture, and the decline of the samurai. We will focus on the political and social history of early modern Japan, including
topics such as the establishment of the Tokugawa order, the nature of the political system, urbanization, popular culture, rural life, gender and sexuality, class and status, religion,
and the fall of the Tokugawa bakufu. Assigned materials will include government documents, literature, and films.

A stunning revolution, the construction and collapse of an empire, the waging of wars, devastating defeat and occupation by a foreign power, and postwar economic rollercoaster
have marked Japan’s modern experience. This course will explore how various Japanese from politicians and intellectuals to factory workers and urban youth have understood,
instigated, and lived the upheavals of the past century and a half. We will ask why a modernizing revolution emerged out of the ashes of the early modern order; how Japan’s
encounters with “the West” have shaped the country’s political and cultural life; what democracy and its failures have wrought; how world war was experienced and what
legacies it left in its wake; how national identity has been constructed and reconstructed; and how postwar Japan has struggled with the successes and costs of affluence. Materials
will include anthropological studies, government documents, intellectual tracts, fiction, films, and oral histories.

This course will introduce students to the history, literature, and artistic culture of premodern Japan, from the time of the first recorded histories in the 800s through the abolition of
the samurai class in the late 1800s. We will focus on the politics and aesthetic culture of the ruling elites in each period, from the heyday of the imperial court through the rise and
eventual decline of the samurai warrior and the growth of Edo (Tokyo), with its new mode of early modern government and new forms of literature, theater, and art. Team taught

166

by faculty from History and Comparative Literature, the course will examine historical texts alongside works drawn from literature, visual culture, and performing arts, and will
ask students to consider how these different kinds of texts can shed light on one another. What is the difference between reading history and reading literature, or is it even
meaningful to distinguish the two? By critically engaging in various kinds of textual analysis, this EDI course not only considers the relationship between politics, culture, and
society in premodern Japan but also explores how we can attempt to know and understand different times and places. Primary texts will include court diaries, war tales, and
fiction; laws and edicts; essays and autobiographies; noh, kabuki, and puppet theater; and tea ceremony, visual art, and architecture. Students should register under the prefix

of the most diverse and complex regions of the world, as it continues to be even today. The course will cover the period between the rise of the Indus Valley civilization to the end
of the Mughal Empire and will address topics such the as the “discovery of India”, the coming of the “Aryans”, society and culture in the great epics like the Ramayana, the
beginnings of Jain and Buddhist thought, politics and patronage under Islamic polities, the formation of Mughal imperial authority through art, architecture and literature, among
others. Through the study of social processes, the course will focus on the diversity and connectedness that have defined the subcontinent throughout its history. It will also
consider the role of history in the region and how a number of events from the past continue to inform its present.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (222-241)
HIST 222(S) Greek History (Same as CLAS 222)
Ancient Greece has been thought to embody the origins of Western civilization in its institutions, values, and thought; it has been seen as the infancy of modern society, with the
attributes of innocence, purity, and the infant’s staggering capacity for exploration and learning; it has been interpreted as an essentially primitive, violent culture with a thin
veneer of rationality; and it has been celebrated as the rational culture par excellence. The study of ancient Greece indeed requires an interpretive framework, yet Greek culture
and history have defied most attempts to articulate one. We will make our attempt in this course by investigating ancient Greece as a set of cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as it
so often was to its own intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreciate the rich and very real connections between ancient Greek and modern Western civilization. The
course will begin with Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest developments in Greek culture, and will conclude with the spread of Greek influence into Asia through the conquests
of Alexander the Great. We will explore topics such as the aristocratic heritage of the city-state, the effects of pervasive war on Greek society, the competitive spirit in political and
religious life, the confrontations with the East, the relationship of intellectual culture to Greek culture as a whole, Greek dependence on slavery, and the diversity of political and
social forms in the Greek world. The readings will concentrate on original sources, including historical writings, philosophy, poetry, and oratory. The class will meet once a week
for a lecture, and will divide into two discussion sections for the second meeting of the week.

HIST 223 Roman History (Same as CLAS 223) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions, religion, and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual
antecedents of European cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural universals. Yet Roman history also encompasses the most
far-reaching experience of diverse cultures, beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close analysis of Roman history on its own
terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambitious, self-confident nation’s encounter both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with other peoples. As
this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive
Roman ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex tendency later to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and
inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and
difference on the other. Readings for this course will concentrate on a wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the problems of historical interpretation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly brief in-class response papers, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

The European world saw dramatic changes and the creation of new cultures and societies between the ancient and modern periods. This course will survey more than a millennium of history, beginning late in classical antiquity and concluding at the dawn of the modern era. We will concentrate both on developments within Europe, and on European
encounters with Islam, the Byzantine East, and pagan cultures. With an approach that is both chronological and thematic, we will place the broader narrative of medieval history
alongside special consideration of Europe’s neighbors, social organization, medieval women, religion and piety, and education. Lectures and class discussion will receive equal

This course surveys European imperialism in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, paying special attention to important case studies such as British India, the Scramble
for Africa, and the break-up of the Ottoman Empire following World War I. The class will both compare European societies, especially insofar as their rival imperial policies
contributed to World War I, and European and non-European cultures as they confronted one another for the first time. Issues to be explored include imperialism and its relationship to Christianity, gender, racism, and economic profit. In the second half of the course, we will examine two of the most dramatic cases of decolonization, Gandhi and Nehru’s
independence movement in India and Patrice Lumumba’s torturous struggle for independence in Lumumba’s Congo. As a transatlantic and transpacific course focusing on race
relations, power and privilege, this course fulfills the EDI requirement.

What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eighteenth century in Europe and has dominated Jewish history throughout the
modern period. Although Jewish emancipation and citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both cases Jews were confronted by unprecedented
opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society and unprecedented challenges to Jewish communal life. This course will introduce students to the major social, cultural,
religious, and political transformations that shaped the lives of Europe’s Jews from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the aftermath of World War II. We will explore such
topics as emancipation, Jewish diversity, the rise of religious denominations within Judaism, competing political ideologies, Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jewish women,
Jewish responses to Nazism, and the situation of Jews in the immediate postwar period. In addition to broad historical treatments, course materials will include memoirs and

Across the entire world of the Middle Ages, no region has captured the modern pop-culture imagination as much as medieval England. From the Battle of Hastings to Magna

from the Roman period through the reign of Richard II (AD 43-1399). We will find a great deal to detain us in these thirteen centuries, including the Anglo-Saxon settlement of
England and subsequent conversion to Christianity, the Viking raids of the ninth and tenth centuries, the Norman Conquest, the growth of English common law, the murder of
Thomas Beckett, Edward I’s campaigns in Wales and Scotland, the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, and the beginning of the Hundred Years War. We will focus particularly on power
and politics, but primary readings will add important social, cultural and religious context. Our meetings will emphasize lectures and discussion equally. No prior knowledge is

HIST 240(F) Muscovy and the Russian Empire
Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy created an extensive multi-ethnic and multi-religious empire in Eastern Europe
and Asia. Over the next 150 years their imperial heirs transformed and extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War (1853-1855) many believed it to be
the most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to provoke a process of state-led reform that failed to avert, and
may well have contributed to, the collapse of the regime in the February Revolution of 1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course will explore the
character of the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped their formation, expansion, and, in the latter case, collapse.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (242-251)
HIST 242(F) Latin America From Conquest to Independence
This course will examine the processes commonly referred to as the creation of “Latin America” and will do so from numerous perspectives. Starting with the construction of
indigenous societies, from small and decentralized groupings to huge imperial polities, before 1492 to the invasion of Europeans from that date forward, we will take up the
question of the Iberian conquest, looking at the often violent encounters that made up that event and analyzing its success, limits, and results. We will then study the imposition of

168

Iberian rule from the point of view of would-be colonizers and the peoples they treated as objects of colonization, stressing the multiple and conflicting character of European,
indigenous, and African perspectives. Thus looking at the Americas from both the outside—in and inside—out, we will focus on the unequal relations of power that came to
define cultural, political, and economic life in the colonies, always with an eye on the gendered and racialized nature of those relations. We will also not only compare very
different regions of the Iberian Americas but also see how the grand shifts of history intervened in-and perhaps consisted of-the most normal elements of daily life in northern
Mexico, the central Andes, coastal Brazil, and other parts of colonial Latin America. Visual as well as more traditional written primary materials, along with secondary texts and
films, will serve as the basis for our discussions throughout the semester.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers (4-5 pages), and a take-home final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

HIST 243(S) Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present
This course will examine salient issues in the history of the independent nations of Latin America. The first two sections of the course will focus on the turbulent formation of
nation-states over the course of the “long nineteenth century,” from the crises of the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires in the late eighteenth century to the heyday of liberal
political economies at the turn of the twentieth century. In this regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the period up to World War I and the possibilities
they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics addressed will include caudillismo, the role of the Church in politics, economic dependency and development, and
the place of indigenous and African Latin-American peoples in new nations, and industrialization and urbanization. The latter two sections will examine the trend toward stateled national development in the twentieth century, considering the diverse forms it took and conflicts it generated in different nations and periods. Here we will take up questions
of the emergence of workers’ and women’s movements and the rise of mass politics; militarism, democracy, and authoritarian governments; the influence of the U.S. in the
region; and the life and possibly death of revolutionary options. Within this chronological framework of national and regional political economy, we will consider the ways that
various Latin American social actors shaped their own lives and collective histories, sometimes challenging and sometimes accommodating the ideals of national elites. General
regional trends will be illustrated by selected national cases, including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two shorts papers (3-5 pages), and a take-home final exam.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: UNITED STATES (252-291)
HIST 252(F) North American History to 1865
This course will provide a survey of North American history from Europe’s first expansion into the New World to the American Civil War. Cast as a contest between competing
empires and their peoples, the course begins in Europe and Native North America before contact and studies the expansion of European nations into the New World. The course
will emphasize the history of British North America and the interactions between and among the many peoples of colonial America. The course will then examine the coming,
course, and consequence of the American Revolution (or what many at the time considered America’s first civil war). The new nation unleashed massive and far-reaching
economic, social and political changes. The last third of the course will explore these changes in the antebellum era and trace how they affected the coming of America’s second
civil war.

HIST 262(S) The United States and the World, 1776 to 1914
From its foundation in 1776 to the beginning of World War I in 1914, the United States developed a complex of ideas for understanding—and methods for securing —its place in
the world. During this period, the nation’s diplomacy went through several phases as it made the transition from a young republic struggling to conduct its diplomacy, to an
expansionist power in the first half of the nineteenth century, to an emerging world power in the aftermath of the Civil War, and then to an imperialist power after the SpanishAmerican War. Amidst these events, U.S. statesmen and citizens constantly debated the country’s proper diplomatic role and struggled to construct and propagate a unique
American ideology, as well as an advantageous geo-strategic position, on the global stage. Debates about foreign relations were imbued with questions of race, nation, independence, religion, economy, law, gender, and geographic expansion; indeed, defining U.S. foreign relations was a means of defining the nation itself. Through a variety of primary
sources and scholarly books and articles, this course will examine U.S. relations with external powers as well as the interactions that occurred between U.S. domestic and foreign
policy during this period.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two 5- to 7-page papers, quizzes, and a midterm exam.

HIST 263(F) The United States and the World, 1914 to the Present
This course explores America’s engagement with the world from 1914 to the present. The First World War ushered in a new era for U.S. foreign relations. The self-identified
isolationist power became a principal player on the world stage and by the end of the Second World War emerged as one of the two global superpowers, poised to compete with
the Soviet Union in a protracted Cold War. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, some spoke of the United States as a “hyperpower,” but how it should exercise its unrivalled
power was far from clear. Through a mixture of lecture and discussion, this course introduces students to the key events of America’s most powerful century and to the new wave
of scholarly literature being written about the United States and the World. Readings will reflect current trends in the sub-field, which focuses not only on high-level diplomacy,
but also on a range of other factors that influence foreign relations, including ideology, race, gender, culture, domestic politics, and the roles of individual personalities.

HIST 280 African American History: An Introduction (Same as AFR 280) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course provides a survey of African American History from the earliest importation and migration of Africans to North American through the present day. Our readings and
discussions will take up the development, expansion, and organization of slavery, the coming and meaning of freedom, and the political and cultural landscapes of African
Americans over time. We will discuss slavery, freedom, civil rights, and racial ideologies. Finally, we will examine the post Civil Rights era, the changing meaning of the
designation “African American” in light of global migrations, and African American political power in the 21st century. Our readings, which will include both primary and
secondary sources, will help us to interrogate American history and gain an understanding and overview of African American history. The course will be primarily discussion
based. Given its focus on the workings of racial ideology and the development of slavery and other forms of unfree labor in the U.S. economic system, this course fulfills the
criteria of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.

HIST 281 African-American History, 1619-1865 (Same as AFR 281) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course provides an introduction to the history of African Americans in United States during the colonial, early republic, and antebellum eras. The course demonstrates how
economically, culturally, and politically, African Americans shaped and were shaped by the historical landscape of the nation. The experience of enslavement necessarily dominates this history, and it is the contours and nuances of slavery—and the development of racial classifications—that give this course its focus. But with a attention centered on
African Americans, the course also explores African cultural influences, the significance of gender, the lives of free blacks, and the cultural and intellectual significance of the

169

abolitionist movement. The course closes on the themes that emerge from the war between the states, and on the meaning of freedom and emancipation. Our readings will
include primary sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will combine lecture and discussion. Informed participation in class discussion is essential.
This EDI course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the New World (and the Old), as well as the myriad ways in
which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. and/or European hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.

century. Course themes will include: the changing meanings of freedom, equality, and rights; the intersection of ideology and activism; the disconnection between local and
national perspectives. Additionally, the course explores the political nature and development of African-American protest traditions, giving particular attention to the rise of Jim
Crow, the franchise, black institutional and organizational life, black migration and urbanization, the black freedom movement and its legacy, and the demise of the liberal
coalition. This EDI course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the New World (and the Old), as well as the myriad

HIST 284(F) Introduction to Asian American History (Same as AMST 284 and ASST 284) (D)
This course serves as the introduction to Asian American history, roughly covering the years 1850 to the present. It examines the lives of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos,
Indians, and Southeast Asians in America, and the historical reasons why they came to the US and their subsequent interactions with other ethno-racial groups in the United
States. Topics include the anti-Asian exclusion movements, the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans, the increase of Asian immigration after the 1965 Immigration Act
and the war in Viet Nam, and the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on Asian American communities. These themes and others will be explored through the use of
historical texts, primary documents, novels, memoirs, and films. This is an EDI course because it examines how people from different Asian countries and cultures interacted
with each other and those already here in the US. Theirs is a story of immigration, exclusion, resistance, accommodation, and the process of “becoming American.”

HIST 286 Latina/o History From 1846 to the Present (Same as LATS 286) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course examines the formation of Latina/o communities in the United States from 1846 to the present. Formed through conquest, immigration, and migration, these communities reflect the political and economic causes of migration, U.S. foreign policies, the connections between the United States and the countries of origin, and economic conditions
in the United States. People’s migration to the United States has been mediated through labor recruitment, immigration and refugee policies, and social networks. Mexicans,
Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent immigrants from Central and South American countries, then become racialized populations in the United States.
This EDI course examines the racial dynamics at play in the formation of Latina/o communities, as well as the impact of dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, gender and class on
the economic incorporation of Latinas and Latinos.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and group presentations, short writing assignments, two short essays, and a final essay.

MAJOR SEMINARS (301)
Major seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars
vary in topic and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself—on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence
and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do
historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several major seminars will be offered.
Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Major Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the
whole of their junior year are encouraged to do so.
HIST 301A Approaching the Past: History, Theory, Practice (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will explore how the discipline of ‘History’ has come to assume its present form and how a number of historians since the 1820s have understood their craft. We will
begin by discussing the work of three great nineteenth-century historians (Macaulay, Marx, and Ranke) who believed that historical “truth” existed and could, with skill, be
deciphered. Next we will explore the philosophy and practice of the cultural and social historians of the 1960s/1970s, comparing and contrasting it with that of their nineteenthcentury predecessors. We will then consider the work of those recent theorists who have tried to refute historians’ claims to be able to capture the “truth” of the past, focusing on
the state of the field in the wake of challenges posed to its epistemological foundations by “post-modernism.” We will conclude with an assessment of the state of the discipline
today. In general, we will be less concerned with “the past” than with what historians do with “the past.” Consequently, we will focus primarily on those abstract, philosophical
assumptions that have informed the practice of history.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 250-word position statement (“What is History?”), two 9- to 11-page interpretive essays, and a take-home
final exam.
Prerequisites: restricted to History majors. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Preference given to senior, then junior, History majors.
Not available for the Gaudino option.

HIST 301B Approaching the Past: Documentary Studies and African American History (Not offered 2013-2014)
Comprised of non-traditional sources—photographs, oral history, narratives, folklore, films, fiction, music, poetry, art and other forms—documentary served historically to
engender a progressive agenda by projecting the voices of the voiceless in order to illuminate the need for social change. Some examples include Jacob Riis’ photographs of the
Lower East Side, Louis Lomax’s efforts to record folk music, Stud Terkel’s interviews with ordinary Americans. But what documentarians have produced also provides a way to
access information about the past, especially the stories of people whose lives have not been preserved through archival materials. This course examines the historical development of documentary forms and reviews the work of specific documentarians. It will focus in particular on the uses of various types of documentary as primary sources for
research in African American history. Familiar formats, from Frederick Douglass’ autobiographies to Henry Hampton’s “Eyes on the Prize” series, recorded AND told histories
that still remain mostly veiled. But in its unprocessed or raw form—collected work songs, sermons, tall tales, blues lyrics, family snapshots, oral history, and the like—documentary provides a store of rich primary sources that access the voices less often heard. This course will explore that material and what historians do with it.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly written critiques, and a final paper/project.
Prerequisites: restricted to History majors. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Preference given to senior, then junior, History majors.
Not available for the Gaudino option; cannot be taken pass/fail.

HIST 301C Approaching the Past: Practices of Modern History (Not offered 2013-2014)
What is history? What is it that historians do? In this course, students will explore questions of how and why we historians practice our craft. The first section of the course will
examine how historians come to know, think about, and understand the past. Issues of the nature of historical “truth,” objectivity and bias, types of sources, and uses of theory will
be discussed. Next, we will address the ways in which historians write about the past, considering the influence of postmodernism on historical narratives, and historical film.

170

Finally, we will examine the uses of history, including public history, history education, and the construction of historical memory. The class will meet once a week, and each
session will focus on some theoretical material as well as readings that concretely illustrate the methodological issues at stake. These readings will be drawn from a broad range of
topics, such as the Great Depression, the Nanking Massacre, and the assassination of JFK.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, short essays, and a final paper.

HIST 301D Approaching the Past: Is History Eurocentric? (Not offered 2013-2014)
The modern historical profession is very much a European creation, originating in the Age of Enlightenment. Championing reason and challenging religious views of the past,
the Philosophes linked the new secular study of man and his society to a view of historical progress. Some have argued that the very nature of the historical discipline is Eurocentric, based as it is on Western concepts of reason, science, and historical evolution which privilege European history at the expense of its non-Western counterparts. In this course,
we will study some of the important spokesmen for historical progress (Voltaire, Condorcet, Marx, von Ranke) as well as some of their important critics. The first half of the
course will survey the history of the historical profession from the Enlightenment to the present. In the second half of the course, we will read some of the great works of history
which have attempted to explain the rise of the west, grappling with how and to what extent these interpretations are Eurocentric.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two 10- to 12-page papers, and a final exam.

HIST 301E(F) Approaching the Past: Modern National, Transnational, and Postcolonial Histories
This course examines the practice of history from the nineteenth century to the present. We will examine the sources, methods, and theoretical assumptions that have shaped the
historical craft in this period, as well as the deeper questions that all historians must confront, implicitly or explicitly: What is “history”? Who makes it and how? To address these
issues, we will discuss the work of canonical and non-canonical historians from across the world, and from outside as well as inside the academy. The particular focus will be on
the production of history from the rise of the nation-state through the spread of new imperialisms in the late nineteenth century and on to the emergence of the “Third World,”
decolonization, and the “new globalization” over the course of the twentieth century. In weekly seminar meetings we will analyze texts and how their authors define historical
subjects/actors and processes, as well as the meanings of history for different audiences and eras.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, short essays, and a final paper.

HIST 301F(S) Approaching the Past: Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our national history, a history that is constructed of individual, collective, and
a national memory of the past and its meanings. This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is presented and (re)presented, such as
monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly historical writing, by considering a number of pivotal events, institutions, or eras in American history. Potential
topics are slavery, race, and the Civil War; westward expansion; the Great Depression; World War II; the Sixties; the war in Viet Nam; and the events and aftermath of September
11, 2001.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly response papers, a book review, an exercise with the Williams College Museum of Art, and a final project to be completed in consultation with the professor. Students will be required to lead a class discussion.

HIST 301G Approaching the Past: Writing the Past (Not offered 2013-2014)
“History” refers to the aggregate of past events as well as to the branch of knowledge that seeks to understand those past events. Whereas history courses often take as their
content the first of these two meanings of history, focusing on the politics, society, and culture of a particular place in a particular historical era, this course will examine history’s
often concealed “other” meaning: the practices of historians, their methods and assumptions. In so doing, this course aims to unsettle history majors’ own assumptions about
what history “is” and what historians “do”. How do historians reconstruct the past, and how and why have their approaches to sources, theories, and narrative strategies changed
over time? And on a deeper level, how have historians’ suppositions changed—if they have changed—about the nature of historical truth, knowledge, and the value of history to
the societies in which they wrote? Taking history-writing itself as our object of study, over the course of the semester we will read the work of twelve, quite different historians
from the classical to the modern era. Each week in our seminar meetings, we will subject these texts to a careful reading in order to understand and assess these historians’
theories and practices.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical response papers to the assigned reading, and a final paper.

HIST 301K(S) Approaching the Past: Varieties of Historical Thinking
This course is designed to acquaint students with some of the ways historians have thought about the past. Beginning with Thucydides’ The Peloponnesian War, the work of
eleven historians will be studied closely and critically over the course of the semester. In the process, students not only will become familiar with various important historical
approaches but will also be encouraged to examine their own assumptions about the past and about how and why—or even if—we know it. We will meet weekly to define,
understand, and assess the different ways historians considered in the course have thought about the past.
Format: discussion. Requirements: in preparation for class discussion, students are required to produce a 1-page critical response to the assigned reading each week, which will
form the basis for class discussion; in addition to writing ten critical responses, students are also required to make an oral presentation of approximately twenty minutes on a
professor they have had in a history course at Williams College.

HIST 301M(F) Approaching the Past: Westward Expansion in American History
How does historical knowledge evolve? How do historians build on but also repudiate the work of historians that came before them? In this course, we will explore the historiography that has developed over the last 150 years about the Anglo-American settlement of the West, using it as a lens to explore larger questions about shifting perspectives of the
historian’s craft. This historiography will also illuminate critical conflicts about the meaning of American history. Did the frontier build American character, as Frederick Jackson
Turner argued in 1893? Did it establish patterns of conquest that have shaped American policy toward other parts of the world, as later historians would argue? Has the West been
an “exceptional” place or representative of the nation at large? The class will meet twice a week, and the discussions will focus intensively on one book, examining the theoretical
and historical assumptions of the author; how these assumptions shaped the historian’s search for evidence and his or her claims; and the impact they have had on our understanding of the American West.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, a midterm paper, and a final, book review essay.

racist order. We will examine the many forms of black oppression and, also, the various forms of resistance to Apartheid. Some of the themes we will explore include industrialization and the formation of the black working classes, the constructions of race, ethnicities and sexualities, land alienation and rural struggles, township poverty and violence,
Black education, and the Black Consciousness Movement. This EDI course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the

HIST 305 Nation Building: The Making of the Modern Middle East (Same as ARAB 305) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
In 1932, or twelve years into his rule and twelve years after the establishment of Iraq, King Faysal I lamented that there were “no Iraqi people but only unimaginable masses of
human beings, devoid of any patriotic idea, imbued with religious traditions and absurdities, connected by no common tie.” This course will consider how true the King’s
statement still holds by evaluating the various attempts at state and nation building in the modern Middle East and the challenges of statecraft. After assessing some of the more
influential theories of nationalism, we will explore the historical experience of nationalism and national identity in Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Palestine, Iran, and Egypt. What has been
at the basis of nationhood? How did European concepts of nation translate into the Middle Eastern context? What was the role of religion in these modern societies? How did
traditional notions of gender effect concepts of citizenship? We will also explore some of the unresolved issues facing the various nations of the Middle East, such as unfulfilled
nationalist aspirations, disputes over land and borders, and challenges to sovereignty. Finally, we will evaluate the role of foreign powers in nation building in the Middle East and
consider whether the modern concept of the nation has any validity in the Middle Eastern context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on several short papers and a “Magnus” Opus (a.k.a. final research paper).

HIST 306(F) Women and Gender in Middle Eastern History (Same as ARAB 306, INST 306 and WGSS 305)
Contrary to the stereotypical image of an unchanging, universally oppressed Middle Eastern woman, the experiences of women in the Middle East have not remained static
across time and place. We will begin by framing questions of current interest, such as the veil, women’s rights in Islamic law, and female access to economic resources and
political power. We will then examine the foundations of these issues in religious scriptures, legal treatises, historical narratives, and biographical accounts from the pre–modern
Middle East. By investigating how issues of modern relevance have been approached throughout history, we will learn to appreciate the diversity of Middle Eastern women’s
lived experiences and to combat stereotypes with careful historical arguments.
Format: lecture/discussion.

HIST 307(S) Africa, 1945 to the Present (Same as AFR 313)
This course provides a close examination of Africa’s recent history. In 2010, seventeen African countries commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of their accession to independence in 1960. We will begin the class by examining how Africans have debated and remembered this important historical moment. The reading of primary sources and recent
scholarship will help us to historicize the trajectory of African political independence since 1945. Our themes of focus will be: the postwar labor question, the emergence of
African nationalism, debates about postcolonial political orientations, and the current challenges of authoritarianism, economic domination, and demographic growth. We will
question both the historical roots and specificity of these challenges.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: students will be evaluated on class participation, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final project.

HIST 311(S) The United States and the Middle East (Same as ARAB 311)
At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was considered a benign superpower in the Middle East. Americans were known as “innocents abroad” for their educational and philanthropic work. From a distance, American society was admired for its affluence and freedom, and Middle Eastern politicians eagerly sought American advice and
assistance. Today, however, the situation could hardly be more different. This course will examine the remarkable transformation of American involvement in the Middle East.
Significant cultural and political encounters of the latter half of the twentieth century will be assessed in order to identify how the United States has approached the region and
consider the multifaceted and sometimes ambivalent reactions of people in the Middle East to increasing U.S. presence. It will also explore the difficulty the United States has
experienced in balancing diverse, and sometimes conflicting, foreign policy interests, and will evaluate what may account for the increasing level of antagonism and mistrust on
both sides.

HIST 319(F) Gender and the Family in Chinese History (Same as ASST 319 and WGSS 319) (D)
Although sometimes claimed as part of a set of immutable “Asian values,” the Chinese family has not remained fixed or stable over time. In this course, we will use the framework of “family” to gain insight into gender, generational, and sexual roles in different historical periods. Beginning in the late imperial period (16th-18th Centuries), we will
examine the religious, marital, sexual, and childrearing practices associated with the “orthodox” Confucian family. We will then explore the wide variety of “heterodox” practices
in imperial China, debates over and critiques of the family system in the twentieth century, and configurations of gender and family in contemporary China. As an EDI course,

An unabating tension between conflict and cooperation has been an undercurrent of U.S.-Japan relations in the past 150 years, at times erupting into clashes reaching the scale of
world war and at times allowing for measured collaboration. We will explore the U.S.-Japan relationship from the perspectives of both countries with a focus on how culture,
domestic concerns, economic and political aims, international contexts, and race have helped shape its course and nature. This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by examining not just the diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Japan, but also how various types of interactions have influenced the dynamics of
power between these two countries and have shaped the ways in which each country has understood and portrayed the other. Topics will include early U.S.-Japan encounters; the
rise of both countries as imperial powers; the road to, and experience of World War II; the politics and social history of the postwar American occupation of Japan; the U.S.-Japan
security alliance; trade relations; and popular culture. Contemporary topics will also be discussed.

HIST 323 Leadership, Government, and the Governed in Ancient Greece (Same as CLAS 323 and LEAD 323) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Visionary, opportunist, reformer, tyrant, demagogue, popular champion: concise characterization of influential leaders is often irresistible. But placing leaders in their much less
easily encapsulated political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging subjects. Among the questions that will guide our study of
Greek leadership: Was the transformative leader in a Greek city always an unexpected one, arising outside of the prevailing political and/or social systems? To what extent did the
prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative as well as of normative leadership? How did various political and social norms contribute to legitimating particular
kinds of leader? After studying such leaders as the “tyrants” who prevailed in many Greek cities of both the archaic and classical eras, then Athenian leaders like Solon, Cleisthenes, Cimon, Pericles, Cleon, and Demosthenes, and Spartans like Cleomenes, Leonidas, Brasidas, and Lysander, we will focus on Alexander the Great, whose unique accomplishments transformed every aspect of Greek belief about leadership, national boundaries, effective government, the role of the governed, and the legitimacy of power. Readings
will include accounts of leadership and government by ancient Greek authors (e.g. Homer, Solon, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, all in translation) and
contemporary historians and political theorists.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, three short papers (4-6 pages each), a midterm exam, and an oral presentation leading

HIST 326(F) War in European History
From the ancient world to the twentieth century, war has always played an important part in European history. Europeans have not only constantly been at war with other
Europeans, but also with neighboring cultures and, indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the history of European warfare from its origins
in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in the early modern period (1450-1815), and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist struggles of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. Has there been a distinctively “European Way of War” from the beginning? How do we explain failure and success in European wars? What exactly happened at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused changes in the organization and waging of European war from one period to the next?

HIST 327 Law in the Middle Ages (Not offered 2013-2014)
Medieval laws form the foundation for much of our modern legal system. They also constitute crucial but problematic sources for our understanding of medieval society. This
course will cover law from the sixth through the fourteenth centuries, with special emphasis on the law of the Roman empire and the law of the Christian church. Through smaller
units on Law in Antiquity, Law in the Early Middle Ages, The High Medieval Legal Tradition, and Marriage in Canon Law, we will gain some exposure to the depth and
complexity of the medieval legal tradition. We will spend most of our time with the legal sources themselves, concentrating specifically on legislation dealing with marriage, the
settlement of disputes, and crime of all kinds. Along the way, we will also study the early history of lawyers and the legal profession. No prior experience with the Middle Ages is
expected.

HIST 328(S) Witchcraft (Same as REL 328)
A wide variety of human cultures have accepted the existence of the supernatural, the reality of magic, and the possibility of magical transgression. Among the most common
supernatural crimes is witchcraft, which societies can invoke to explain natural disasters and disease, and to blame these occurrences on specific individuals, often social outcasts.
Witchcraft became a particular focus of fear and fascination in Early Modern Europe, when inquisitors, theologians and many ordinary people came to believe that Western
Christendom was threatened by a vast, covert conspiracy of witches in league with the devil. Countless “witches”—most of them women—were accordingly tried, tortured and
sometimes even executed. Our course will examine these bizarre events and consider what religious, cultural and intellectual factors might help explain them. We will begin by
investigating the medieval legal and theological developments that enabled and encouraged the persecution of witches, and go on to study some of the most important and
sensational witch trials of the later medieval and early modern periods. Throughout, we will encounter many strange and intriguing documents produced by the inquisitors who
persecuted witches, the scholars who imagined their activities, and the laws that defined their crimes. No prior experience with European history is required for this seminar,
which will emphasize thoughtful writing and discussion.

HIST 333(S) Postwar Britain: Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Change, 1945-1990 (Same as WGSS 332)
A major theme in British historiography is the enormous social change that has taken place in Britain since the end of the Second World War. In the 1950s, sociologists argued
about the extent to which postwar affluence was leading to the “embourgeoisement” of the working class; in the 1960s, the advent of the so-called “Permissive Society” witnessed the flourishing of a new culture of sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll; in the 1970s, the feminist and gay movements challenged gender roles that earlier had seemed so secure; in

173

the 1980s, Thatcherism sought to halt the nation’s apparent terminal decline, repudiating much of the progressive legislation of earlier decades; finally, throughout this period
successive ways of immigration challenged the cultural homogeneity of white Britain. This course will explore these themes, addressing the question of what it meant to be
“postwar” in Britain, charting the gradual emergence of a new politics of class, gender, race, and sexuality in Britain that the made the nation in 1990, at the end of the postwar
period, a radically different place from what it had been in 1945. In attempting to make sense of these complex changes, we will consider a variety of documents and works by
recent historians, along with a dozen films, which students will be required to view outside of class.

HIST 334(S) Sex and Psyche: A Cultural History of Fin-de-Siècle Europe (Same as WGSS 334)
This course will introduce students to some of the most significant and exciting social, artistic, intellectual, and political developments in fin-de-siècle Europe (1870 to 1914).
“Fin-de-siècle” is a concept that denotes not only a historical period—the end of a century—but refers to a consciousness of living in a time of accelerated change and crisis.
Intellectuals and artists of the decades we will be examining were preoccupied with “degeneration,” loss of innocence, meaning, morality, and the inner self. They were simultaneously fascinated and horrified by technological innovation, emergent political and ideological currents, and the challenges to traditional values and identities posed by them.
After a survey of political upheavals during the European fin-de- siècle, the course will focus on three metropolises consecutively: Vienna, Paris, and St. Petersburg. Through
analyses of historical literature, novels, music, visual art, and the seminal texts of psychoanalysis we will explore how the self, public life, gender relations, sexuality, and aesthetics were conceived and re-imagined in each city, and bring to light the sensibilities and culture they shared.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, two short critical essays based on class readings, and a final research paper.

The Weimar Republic has been examined and re-examined, not only in an effort to account for the failure of democracy and the rise of Hitler in Germany but also for its
remarkable artistic achievements. Using a variety of primary documents, including movies, works of art and literature, as well as more traditional historical sources and the
writings of historians, this course will consider the social, political, and cultural history of the Weimar Republic. At issue in the course will be the relationship between the
political and social instability and the cultural blossoming that characterized in Germany during the 1920s. We will also consider whether the Weimar Republic in general, and
Weimar culture, in particular are better understood as the product of Germany’s past or as harbingers of its future.

This course is a history of National-Socialist Germany based to a considerable extent on primary documents. Students will use the documents to reconstruct the history of the
Third Reich and to articulate and assess some of the principal historiographical debates relating to National-Socialist Germany. The course will consider the following topics: the
failure of the Weimar Republic and the rise of National Socialism; the consolidation of Nazi rule; the experiential reality of the Volksgemeinschaft; the popularity of National
Socialism; youth and women in the Third Reich; Nazi culture; Nazi racism and image of the Jew; Gestapo terror; the pre-war persecution of Jews; popular German anti-Semitism; the regime’s euthanasia program; the Nazi Empire; the experience of war in Russia; the implementation of the “Final Solution to the Jewish Problem”; German knowledge
of and complicity in the “Final Solution”; the experience of “total war” on the home front; resistance to National Socialism; and the collapse of the Third Reich. The course will
focus especially on how ordinary Germans experienced and participated in the history through which they lived. We will take an empathic approach to National-Socialist Germany and to the Germans who lived through this period, attempting to understand why they felt, thought, and acted as they did. We will also consider the epistemological and ethical
problems involved in attempting to empathize with Nazis.

HIST 338 The History of the Holocaust (Same as JWST 338 and REL 296) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In twenty-first century United States, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Germany remains a central event in our political, moral, and cultural
universe. Nevertheless, the Holocaust still confounds historians’ efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and the suffering of the victims. In this course, we
will study the origins and unfolding of Nazi Germany’s genocidal policies, taking into consideration the perspectives of those who carried out mass murder as well as the
experiences and responses of Jews and other victim groups to persecution. We will also examine the Holocaust within the larger context of the history of World War II in Europe
and historians’ debates about Germany’s exterminatory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, speeches, bureaucratic documents, memoirs, films, and historical scholarship.

The Spanish conquest of the Americas happened with astonishing rapidity: Christopher Columbus entered the Caribbean in 1492; Hernando Cortes completed the conquest of
the Aztecs of central Mexico in 1521; Francisco Pizarro triumphantly entered the Inca capital Cuzco, in Peru, in 1533. Other conquistadors pushed north to the Carolinas and
California, south to the Tierra del Fuego and the River Plate, and across the Amazon basin to the Atlantic. “We came,” wrote the conquistador Bernal Dias del Castillo, “to serve
God, and our King, and to get rich.” Their deeds were legendary, the courage, daring, and endurance remarkable. They were also notoriously quarrelsome, greedy, and cruel.
Before their onslaught the major civilizations of the New World crumbled—destroyed or changed beyond recognition. Rarely in history have so few conquered so many so
quickly. The conquest of the New World has both excited and appalled the human imagination for more than five centuries. Many questions remain to be answered or are still
capable of provoking controversy. Who exactly were the conquistadors? What motivated them? What meaning did they themselves assign to their actions? How could they
justify their many misdeeds? How did they develop their sense of the Other? Why did resistance by indigenous peoples and regimes ultimately fail? Was the conquest somehow
preordained? What mixture of human agency, culture, technology, religion, nature, and biology can best explain the results of this encounter between the conquistadors and the
Amerindian worlds?

HIST 346 History of Modern Brazil (Same as AFR 346) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Brazil has been “the country of the future” far longer than it has been an independent nation. Soon after Europeans descended on its shores, Brazil was hailed as a land of
resources so rich and diverse that they would inevitably produce great wealth and global power for its inhabitants. Although this has often lent a booster-ish quality to its descriptions of the country, it has also brought ambiguity—for if the label suggests Brazil’s potential, it also underlies the country’s failure to live up to that promise. Being an eternal
“country of the future” must be as much a troubling as a cheering designation. This course will examine the modern history of that country of the future by taking up major

174

themes from independence to the present. Beginning with what was by Latin American standards an easy transition from colony to independent empire, we will analyze the
hierarchies that have characterized Brazilian society and their relation to the political and economic evolution of the Brazilian nation-state. The course will give particular attention to the themes of race, gender, and citizenship; national culture and modernity; and democracy and authoritarianism in social and political relations. Combining cultural,
political, and social analyses, this course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement by examining a range of written texts and other sources to understand these and
other themes in the lives of Brazilians of different social identities and political standings since Independence.

years. This course will examine the historical creation of both democratic and anti-democratic regimes in different national cases, seeking to identify the conditions that have
fostered the apparent persistence of dictatorial tendencies in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, and the countries of Central America. In this regard we will look at the social and
economic forces as well as the political actors and ideologies that have contributed to distinct, if often parallel, outcomes. At the same time, we will also question the criteria we
use to label regimes “democratic” or “dictatorial” —and the implications of our choice of criteria.

HIST 355(F) Perspectives on the American Revolution (Same as LEAD 255)
The American Revolution remains one of the most-studied events in American history. Yet, agreement about its main causes, significance, and purpose remains as distant as ever.
Some historians argue that political ideas and principles brought about calls for Independence. Others emphasize the economic motives behind revolutionary fervor. Still others
argue that British political institutions failed to adapt to the needs of a growing empire, leading colonists to replace British imperial rule with a form of government suited to their
local exigencies. Some have told the story through the eyes of the Founding Fathers, while others have explored what the American Revolution meant for the lived experience of
average citizens, of women, of free and enslaved African Americans, of Native Americans, and of peoples living beyond North America. Collectively, such a range of studies
speaks to the significance of the American Revolution. Individually, however, these varying perspectives provide a fragmented picture of the era and its people. Through readings, lectures, and primary sources, this class will explore these different views of the Revolution and try to create some synthetic unity out of this historical kaleidoscope.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation (20%), mid-term (20%) and final (25%) exams, and a final project (35%).

HIST 362 The 1980s (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will consider whether and how the 1980s are coming into view as history. Conventional wisdom views the 1980s as being defined by selfishness, greed, and materialism, but that decade also saw society engaged in serious debates about individual and social responsibility, the relationship between the state and society, and about America’s
role in the world. Understanding this era involves tackling broader questions about liberalism, conservatism, the welfare state, the cold war, globalization, the presidency, social
movements, identity politics, popular culture, religion, and the media in modern U.S. history. This course will address some of these questions, examine the varieties of ways in
which individuals and social groups conceived and reconceived their personal and political identities, and explore various methods used to assess contemporary history.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on several short writing assignments; two 4- to 5-page essays; and a research paper (12-15 pages).

HIST 364(F) History of the Old South (Same as AFR 364 and AMST 364)
During the course of the semester, we shall investigate two broad, interrelated topics: slavery in the antebellum South, and the impact of slavery on Southern civilization. Our
approach will be primarily topical. In the first half of the course, we shall look at subjects like the foreign and domestic slave trade, patterns of work and treatment, the nature of
the master-slave relationship, resistance and rebellion, and slave cultural, social, and family life. The second half of the course will concentrate on the influence of the institution
of slavery on the mind, social structure, and economy of the Old South, and slavery’s impact on Southern politics and the decision for secession in 1860-61.
Format: discussion. Evaluation based on class participation, two papers of moderate length, and a comprehensive final examination.

HIST 367 Frontiers in Early American History, 1607-1846 (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will tackle one of the most hotly debated topics in American history: the significance of the frontier to the development of North America. The course will have two
core themes: the history and historiography of the early American frontier and the various conceptions of the frontier in popular culture and works of fiction. It will explore the
changing nature of the frontier (and scholarly interpretations of it) in early American history, tracing expansion, development, and conflict from its earliest occurrences in Virginia
and New England to the Mexican-American War of 1846. The course will be interdisciplinary in nature with readings and assignments ranging from scholarly writings to
fictional works and from contemporary movies to primary sources. This approach will help address questions that historians and the public alike have struggled to answer: What
was life really like on a frontier? How do popular conceptions comport with historical realities of frontier life? What exactly did the frontier mean to American history?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation (20%), 2 short writing assignments (10% each), midterm exam/project (25%), and a final project (35%).

HIST 371(S) The History of U.S. Environmental Politics (Same as ENVI 371)
The politics surrounding the environment today are a super-heated source of conflict, at the same time that most opinion polls show that Americans widely embrace many
environmental protections. While environmental concerns have long been a part of local politics in America, this course will “largely explore the emergence and prominence of
environmental issues in national politics” from the first organized conservation efforts in the late nineteenth century to the present-day concerns with the global environment.
Throughout the course, we will investigate both how changes in the environment have shaped American politics and how political decisions have altered the American, as well
as the global environment, with particular attention to which groups of people have had, or have not had, access to political processes and institutions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, an analytical essay, and a final exam.

HIST 374 American Medical History (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will cover major themes in American medical history and historiography from the colonial period through the twentieth century. Every aspect of American “medicine” underwent tremendous transition during the period we will study. Medical education, the medical profession, and notions about cures and care changed fundamentally, as
did ideas about the nature of illness itself. Our course of study, in addition to charting ways in which the practice of medicine in America has developed, will make an equal effort
to understand how medicine has changed and affected American society. Topics that we will investigate include cholera, TB, and childbirth in American society, as well as other
medical phenomena.

HIST 375 History of American Childhood (Same as AFR 375) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Over the course of American history both the experience of childhood and our understandings of childhood have changed radically. Children have been bought and sold as
slaves, hanged as convicted witches, and purchased slaves themselves. A century ago many children were sent “out to work” at ages that our society now defines as too young
even to be left alone in the house. Common experiences of modern middle-class American childhood—summer camp, secondary school, and organized youth sports teams—are
recent additions to American life. Through reading works of history and autobiography we will explore American childhood and what attitudes toward specific groups of children reveals about American society. This course is an EDI course; as such, we will consistently study groups of children that differ by race and class. In addition, we will
interrogate the category of childhood and debate its universality and usefulness. Does the experience of childhood help to “unify” diverse groups of people?
Format: lecture/discussion. Students will be required to write three papers and be expected to contribute actively to class discussion.

HIST 377(F) Race and American Law (Same as AFR 377, AMST 377, JLST 377, LATS 377 and LEAD 377) (D)
American race history has its deepest and most troubled roots in racial slavery—a system protected by the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes and state laws. This course
will first examine the core theme of Black and White race relations, beginning with the slavery clauses of the Constitution and continuing through the color-blind
affirmative action decisions of the Supreme Court. This examination of Black and White racial construction will study the implicit definitions of race, racism and the
power relations of racial subordinations. The class will next examine groups recognized in the law—American Indians, Asian Americans, and Latinos/as, with a focus
upon their emergence as legal and historical actors. Each group will be examined as case studies in multiple forms of racial subordination. For American Indians, the
theme is sovereignty and forced Americanization. For Asian Americans, we examine the creation of the racial themes of foreignness, model-minority and the post- 9-11
Islamic/Jihadist Terrorist. For Latinos, we will focus upon imperial conquest, immigration and “Latin” racial classifications.
The course will use primary legal materials—edited Supreme Court opinions, federal and state statutes—as well as other legal commentaries.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 3-page reflection/racial narrative; a 3-page reflection on Black-White race; an annotated bibliography and final research paper of
15-20 pages.

HIST 378 The History of Sexuality in America (Same as WGSS 378) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Sex is often thought of as an unchanging need, behavior, or instinct—a form of experience without history. And yet even in the recent past, sexual desires, acts, identities,
attitudes, and technologies have undergone profound transformations. This course explores those transformations, tracing the shifting and contested meanings and experiences of
sex and sexuality from the pre-colonial period to the present, and examining how and why sexuality has become so central to identities, culture, politics, and history. To understand how sexuality has been regulated by the state and what sexuality has meant to ordinary Americans in the past, we will use a wide range of primary sources, including as
private letters, law cases, photographs, films, and music. Many of the topics are relevant to contemporary public debates, including controversies over censorship, sexual violence, gay and lesbian sexualities, transgender identities and politics, abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm examination, several short papers, and a 10- to 12-page research paper.

As slaves and free women, activists, domestics, artists and writers, African Americans have played exciting and often unexpected roles in U.S. political, social, and cultural
history. In this course we will examine black women’s lives from the earliest importation of slaves from Africa and the Caribbean through to the expansion of slavery, the Civil
War, freedom, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movements, and up to the present day. Consistent themes we will explore are the significance of gender in African American history
and the changing roles and public perceptions of black women both inside and outside the black community. We will read and discuss a combination of primary and secondary
sources; we will also consider music, art, and literature, as well as more standard “historical” texts. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that
it focuses on empathetic understanding, power and privilege, especially in relation to class, gender, and race within a U.S. context.

HIST 380 Comparative American Immigration History (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course examines the underlying tension between the notion of American pluralism and the desire for homogeneity through the study of the history of immigration to the
United States from Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Special attention will be paid to the condition in the sending countries and the
historical ties of those countries to the United States, immigration and labor recruitment, anti-immigrant sentiments, and the development of American immigration policy. This
is an EDI course because it examines how people from different countries and cultures interacted with each other and those already in the United States. Theirs is a story of
immigration, exclusion, resistance, accommodation, labor and the creation of an American image of pluralism, coupled with the desire for assimilated immigrants.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two short critical essay (5-7 pages) and a final oral history/family history 15-20 pages).

HIST 381 From Civil Rights to Black Power (Same as AFR 381) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Focusing on African Americans’ demands for the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, and placing their perspectives at the center, this course explores the themes of the
black freedom movement as it transpired in the second half of the twentieth century in the United States. The course follows a chronological format that is grounded in postWorld War II internationalism and domestic Jim Crow, covers the civil rights and the black power movements of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, and then moves toward current issues in
black politics. The topics examined include the strategies and organizing principles of legal challenges, direct action protest, black power activism, coalition building, and public
intellectual engagement. The class also assesses the intersection between ideology/activism, culture/politics, and local/regional/national perspectives. Finally, the course uses the
black freedom movement as a window onto other political initiatives of the era.
Format:lecture/discussion; second weekly meeting will split into two discussion sections. Requirements: willingness to manage an intensive reading schedule and for their
intellectual engagement in class discussions. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, and a take home final.

HIST 383(F) Whiteness and Race in the History of the United States (Same as AMST 383 and WGSS 383) (D)
If race is socially and historically constructed, then the study of race relations in the U.S. extends to the topic of whiteness. And if we are never without the past, then “whiteness”
must be a part of current discussions about politics, citizenship, and social issues. Focusing on how historians have written about whiteness in American history, this course uses
the prism of race to explore social, political, and economic development in U.S. history. The class follows the development of “whiteness” through a chronology that begins in
colonial Virginia, travels through immigration in the nineteenth century, examines racial politics and popular culture in the twentieth century, and ends with a look at the current
election season. This course is framed by several questions: What is whiteness, and what has it meant in the history of the United States? Who is (and is not) white? What about
other analytical categories, like gender and class (or region or ethnicity or sexuality): how have these experiences shaped and been shaped by the racial category of whiteness?
Because historically whiteness has carried overtones of power, privilege, and wealth in the United States, the course necessarily critiques the roots of racial disparities. This class
is not for the faint-hearted. Informed participation is necessary to its success. The course fulfills the requirements for the Exploring Diversity Initiative because it examines the
differences and similarities between white Americans and other American cultures, and because it explores whiteness as a prism for understanding the operations of power and
privilege in American society.
Format: discussion. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, the leading of two class discussions related to the writing of two 3- to 5-page review/response
papers, and a final bibliographical research project.

HIST 384 Comparative Asian-American History, 1850-1965 (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course will focus on the early history of Chinese and Japanese immigrants and their descendents in the United States. We will first look at the immigration patterns of these
two Asian groups to the United States, how they made a living here, and how other Americans reacted to their presence. From there, the course will take an in-depth look at the
anti-Asian movement in this country which culminated in the prohibition of most Chinese immigrants from entering the country and later, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement because it examines the history of the two Asian immigrant groups of this time period
and their relationship to each other and to other ethno-racial groups, all within the context of American history from the Antebellum period through World War II.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of writing assignments: six short response papers, two 5- to 7-page essays, and a 10- to 15-page research paper.

HIST 386 Latinas in the Global Economy: Work, Migration, and Households (Same as LATS 386 and WGSS 386) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course examines the impact of the global economy on Latinas from 1945 to the present, including Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican women, as well as more
recent immigrants from Central and South American countries. Using the garment industry as an example of a labor intensive industry that has gone global, we ask questions
regarding the impact on Latinas in their countries of origin and in the United States. What impact has the global economy and economic development had on Latinas’ work and
their households in their countries of origin? How have economic changes and government policies fostered Latinas’ migrations? How have Latinas been incorporated into the
changing U.S. economy? How have Latinas confronted the challenges created by a globalizing economy? We will also explore the migration and the experiences of Latina
domestics and farm workers, past and present. Focusing on the experiences of Latinas as they become racialized populations in the United States, this EDI course explores the
impact of dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, gender and class on their economic incorporation, as well as the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times
challenge those dominant U.S. hierarchies.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and group presentations, short writing assignments, two short essays, and a final paper that will be presented to

HIST 389(S) The Vietnam Wars (Same as ASST 389)
This course explores Vietnam’s twentieth century wars, including an anti-colonial war against France (1946-1954), a massive Cold War conflict involving the United States
(1965-1973), and postcolonial confrontations with China and Cambodia in the late-1970s. Course materials will focus primarily on Vietnam’s domestic politics and its relations
with other countries. Lectures, readings, films, and discussions will explore the process by which Vietnam’s anti-colonial struggle became one of the central conflicts of the Cold
War, and examine the ramifications of that fact for all parties involved. The impact of these wars can hardly be overstated, as they affected the trajectory of French decolonization,
altered America’s domestic politics and foreign policy, invigorated anti-colonial movements across the Third World, and left Vietnam isolated in the international community.
Students will read a number of scholarly texts, primary sources, memoirs, and novels to explore everything from high-level international diplomacy to personal experiences of
conflict and dramatic social change wrought by decolonization and decades of warfare.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a 10- to 12-page final paper.

How did Germany, Italy, and Japan deal with the economic, political, and social crises of the 1930s? In what ways did each of these three countries navigate the economic
depression, challenges to democracy, and ascendance of totalitarianism that marked this pivotal and transformative decade? This course will take a transnational approach to such
questions, examining various aspects of the politics, economy, society, and culture of the 1930s in Germany, Italy, and Japan. It will explore the origins and rise of Italian fascism,
German National Socialism, and Japanese militarism; the political cultures of charisma, violence, terror, collaboration, and resistance; racism and anti-Semitism; and fascist
aesthetics. We will also consider how these phenomena shaped, and were shaped by, the nature of everyday life in this decade with particular attention to issues of religion,
family, and gender. To conclude the semester, we will discuss how the 1930s have been remembered, and whether we can speak of fascisms at work in the present day. This
course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by comparing how global frustrations and challenges played out both similarly and differently in Germany, Italy, and Japan; and how these countries that would become the axis powers negotiated their particular encounters with fascism.

HIST 391(F) When India was the World: Trade, Travel and History in the Indian Ocean (Same as ASST 391 and INST 391)
Can historians study oceans rather than lands? Is it possible to think about an aquatic space as an integrated cultural region rather than simply focusing on terra–centric empires
and societies? What can we learn about human interactions in the past through the study of oceanic histories? This course seeks to answer these questions by focusing on the
oldest maritime highway in history: the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean connected diverse regions, cultures and communities for millennia, thus making it a vital element in the
birth of globalization. South Asian ports and port cities remained the fulcrum of the Indian Ocean world throughout its history; traders, travellers, nobles, scholars, pilgrims and
pirates from all over the world travelled to the Indian coast in search of adventure, spices, knowledge and wealth. Thus we will primarily focus on India’s role in the Indian Ocean
roughly from the rise of Islam in the seventh century CE through the intrusion of various European communities in the region and the subsequent rise of the global economy and
colonialism in the nineteenth century. Rather than following a strict temporal chronology we will concentrate on themes such a travel and adventure; trade and exchange; trust
and friendship; religion and society; pilgrimage; piracy; the culture of port cities; and food across time.

excitement, superlatives and excesses. More than just the year, 1968 represents the sequence of youth protests that ran, throughout the world, from the mid–1960s to the

HIST 395 Fashioning Bodies: Dress, Consumption, and Gender from the Renaissance to the Present (Same as WGSS 395) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course explores costume and fashion as vehicles for the (re)creation and expression of gender, class, and sexual identities in Europe and the United States. We will begin by
looking at the relationship between fashion and the political and economic power of the courts of early modern Europe. Revolutionary ideologies will be linked to sartorial
politics, consumption of clothing to colonization, and changes in the style of clothing to shifting social norms. As our focus turns to the fashion industry in the twentieth century,
when mass-produced clothing increased the possibility for reflexivity and imaginative play in dress, we will relate representations of the dressed body to the formation of diverse
cultural communities, beauty ideals, and status hierarchies, examining both the normative and subversive potential of fashion. The course considers work in the fields of art
history, cultural history, sociology and anthropology, feminist theory, and fashion journalism to ask questions such as: What are the origins of consumer societies? When, why,
and how were fashion and consumption feminized? Is clothing a language? What cultural, political and social meanings do certain forms of dress generate? What is the relationship between prevalent understandings of the body and fashion? How is clothing used to stigmatize or differentiate individuals and communities? Topics include: the origins of
uniforms and sportswear, eroticism and androgyny in fashion, the cultural politics of ethnic” clothing, and the relationship between the fashion industry and cinema.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, two short critical essays based on class readings, and a final research paper.

centuries. Topics to be covered include Napoleon’s Egyptian Campaign, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Anglo-French rivalry over the Canal and the Suez crisis of 1956, the
Algerian Revolution and the anti-Islamic coup in 1991-2, and the migration of North Africans and Indian/Pakistani Muslims to Europe in the post 1945 period. Racial tensions,
battles over headscarves, French hip-hop music, and Jewish-Muslim relations in contemporary France are among the topics to be explored with an eye to examining how Europe
is coming to terms with its new multicultural identity. By comparing and contrasting Muslim and European societies, and by showing the ways in which colonial power and
racial privilege affected these cultures, this course meets the EDI requirement as it seeks to develop an empathetic understanding of the position of Muslims in Europe today.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST (402-411)
HIST 403 Making it in Africa (Same as AFR 404 and LEAD 403) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Although Africa has come to be known as a continent that relies heavily on foreign aid, that aid rarely reaches ordinary people. In fact, recent studies have suggested that foreign
aid has not helped develop Africa. In spite of the staggering problems that ordinary Africans face, many see Africa—now more than ever before—as a place bursting with
promise and opportunity, even if that opportunity may require challenges to conventional economic and political thinking. Increasingly, an innovative class of entrepreneurs is
emerging in Africa that is hustling in the formal and informal economy in order to accumulate capital. This seminar will trace the social and cultural history of entrepreneurship in
Africa from the 19th century to the present. We will explore the individual journeys of several entrepreneurs, the values and objectives they nurtured, the changes in the strategy
and structure of the businesses they created, and the dynamic environments in which they each lived and worked. The course will also examine the long-term impact of entrepreneurial innovation and market evolution on African communities and governments. Readings will include histories, biographies, autobiographies, ethnographies, and novels.

(Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
What role does ancient history play in modern societies? What is the role of myths and fables in the creation of national identities? This course will address the use and abuse of
ancient history and archaeology in the modern Middle East. The first part will focus on some of the primary ancient texts, with special focus on Ferdowsi’s epic Shahnameh
(Book of Kings); we will compare its themes and world view with those of the Icelandic sagas that share many similarities with the Iranian canon. In the second part of the course

178

we will explore how ancient history, archaeology, and epic texts helped forge national identities in the modern Middle East. Our primary attention will be Iran and its relationship
with the Shahnameh. But we will also consider the relationship of Biblical history to the establishment of modern Israel and Israeli nationalism, how contemporary Egypt relates

ADVANCED SEMINARS: ASIA (412-421)
HIST 414 Merchant Cultures and Capitalist Classes in China and India (Same as ASST 414) (Not offered 2013-2014)
As the expression “Chindia” in the title of a recent book suggests, contemporary commentators find it difficult to resist conflating the rise of China and India as economic powers
in the early 21st century. There are, however, both significant parallels between the two national histories and important distinctions that shape their contemporary viewpoints and
futures. This seminar will examine various historical dimensions of entrepreneurial activity in China and India from the early modern period through the twentieth century. It will
focus on topics such as indigenous forms of merchant organization, the impact of nineteenth-century imperialism, the adoption of Western business forms and methods, and the
relationship of entrepreneurial elites to the modern state.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation in discussion, several short papers, a literature review, and a final research paper.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (422-441)
HIST 424 The Dark Ages: Gaul after the Fall of Rome (Not offered 2013-2014)
What made Antiquity different from the Middle Ages? What changed after the Roman Empire ceased to exist in the West? This seminar will approach these classic problems
through an intense focus on Gaul during the so-called “Dark Ages,” from the fifth to the eighth centuries. During these years, Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty dominated Western Europe. Our sources for these transitional centuries are some of the most colorful and fascinating texts to emerge from the ancient world. We will begin with a look
at life and politics under the later Roman empire, and then make ourselves experts in Merovingian history by studying nearly all the surviving written evidence. Narrative
histories, chronicles and law codes will claim the bulk of our time and attention, but we will also sample documents, literature, and archeological finds. This comprehensive
exposure will prepare us to confront the many scholarly debates that have surrounded the Merovingian age.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on two class presentations, a shorter mid-term paper, and a substantial final research project.

HIST 433 The Justice of Violence? Histories of Terrorism in Europe (Same as JWST 433) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The word “terrorism” entered the English language in 1795, an import from France that referred to the use of violence and intimidation by the ruling party during one phase of the
French Revolution. Over the ensuing two centuries, terrorism has come to refer to the employment of violence, not only as a means of governing, but also and more often as a
means of undermining the authority of those in power. This seminar examines a series of episodes of terrorism in Europe from the “Terror” of the French Revolution to the late
twentieth century. It also explores various interpretations of the legitimacy and ethics of political violence and the phenomenon of terrorism in different historical contexts. In
addition to common readings, students will conduct independent research on some aspect of the history of terrorism that will culminate in a 20-page paper.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, oral presentations, and a 20-page research paper.

HIST 434 The Meaning of Diaspora and the Jews of Europe (Same as JWST 434) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Dispersion, exile, migration, statelessness are all aspects of diaspora. And in the study of diasporic peoples and cultures, the Jews have long figured as the archetype. Indeed, prior
to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, the diasporic condition both defined and, in a meaningful way, was defined by the Jewish experience. As a result, Jewish
political figures, intellectuals, and scholars have played a central role in discussions of the meaning of diaspora, including debates about its political and social implications,
economic value, and cultural significance. This seminar examines various interpretations of Jews’ diasporic existence from the nineteenth century to the present, both as a
cultural practice and a form of group identity from which political claims have been made. Ultimately, this seminar will test the proposition that “The Modern Age is the Jewish
Age,” that is, that the meaning of diaspora in modern Jewish history has direct relevance to students of human identity, not just of Jewishness. In addition to common readings,
students will conduct independent research on some aspect of the history of diaspora that will culminate in a 20-page paper.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, oral presentations, and a 20-page research paper.

HIST 439 Personality, Society, and Identity in Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Russian Thought (Not offered 2013-2014)
This seminar studies the movements and themes of Russian thought from the Enlightenment to 1917, situating works of Russian philosophy and literature, when appropriate,
within the broader context of Western intellectual traditions. We will explore how ideas about human nature and society inspired and gave meaning to political reform, terrorism,
and revolution in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and ponder their relevance in Russia today. The course covers themes such as the individual and society, morality
and love, and time and eschatology, as well as topics like: the problem of national identity, conservatism and radicalism, the forging of the intelligentsia” tradition, the commercialization of culture, and revolutionary language in 1917. Readings include texts by Pushkin, Belinsky, Dostoevsky, Herzen, Tolstoy, Solvyov, Berdiaev, as well as modernist
works (Bely, Blok, Ivanov) and Marxist writings (Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Lenin). We also will read secondary historical literature, watch films, and listen to music in order to gain
a deeper understanding of the cultural environment in which our primary sources were written and the ways social ideals and types were disseminated.
Format: seminar. Knowledge of Russian is NOT a prerequisite for this course. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several oral presentations and short preliminary

HIST 457 Gender, Law, and Politics in U.S. History (Same as WGSS 457) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This seminar explores the legal history of the United States as a gendered system. It examines how women have shaped the meanings of American citizenship through pursuit of
political rights and obligations such as suffrage, jury duty, and military service; how those political struggles have varied across race, religion, and class; and how the legal system
has shaped gender relations for both women and men through regulation of such issues as marriage, divorce, work, reproduction, and the family. While we will read some court
cases, the focus of the seminar is on the broader relationship between law and society. Readings will address not only the history of statutory law, and of the lawsuits and trials
testing those laws, but also the social history of the impact of the law and the political history of efforts to change laws.

HIST 459 Jim Crow (Same as AFR 459) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Between 1865 and 1965 white Americans developed and deployed a set of practices that sanctioned racial discrimination. Jim Crow—as this American system of apartheid was
called— is one of the least studied aspects of U. S. History. This course explores the law, cultural, economics, and politics of Jim Crow; the dynamics of racialized power; and the
roles of media and history in sustaining racial inequality. Informed by how segregation operated to construct and sustain differences, it qualifies as an Exploring Diversity
Initiative course by linking the issue of diversity to the issue of power relations, investigating how American institutions enabled and maintained racial disparities despite constitutional guarantees, and considering how the legacy of racial discrimination affects current domestic issues like public education, affirmative action, and the persistence of
poverty. In addition to covering race theory in historical context, the course suggests that current scientific ideas about race—that there are no consequential biological differences
among humans—is a recent discovery. Finally, the course examines the discrete development of black communities, institutions, politics, and racial destiny.

branches of government, the nation’s political trajectory, the role of media in society, youth culture, race relations, and more. This seminar explores America’s war in Vietnam and
its dramatic ramifications at home and abroad. We will evaluate the Vietnam War era as a turning point in U.S. history—and in the role of the U.S. in the world—by reading and
discussing a number of scholarly works on domestic and international aspects of the conflict. Students will develop an original research topic and research and write a 20- to 25page paper, based in primary sources, on one aspect of America’s Vietnam War.

HIST 469 Notions of Race and Ethnicity in American Culture (Same as AMST 469) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
While “race” and “ethnicity” have always played fundamental roles in shaping the course of American culture and the definition of who is or who can be an “American,” our
understanding of these concepts of race and ethnicity has often been less than clear. The purpose of this seminar is to examine how Americans have defined and articulated the
concepts of race and ethnicity at various points in our history and how these ideas have been expressed in art, policy, practice, and theory. This course fulfills the Exploring
Diversity Initiative because it examines various dynamics of power structures based on race and ethnic politics, as well as class and gender relations.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on weekly response papers, an exercise with the Williams College Museum of Art, an annotated bibliography, and a final research

HIST 475 Modern Warfare and Military Leadership (Same as LEAD 475) (Not offered 2013-2014)
From the early nineteenth to the twenty-first century, modern history has been marked by numerous wars fought by nation states. Some of these wars were enormously destructive. Some changed history decisively on a continental or global scale. This modern period of warfare witnessed rapid and dramatic changes in the manner military forces were
organized, armed, and led, and in their scale and lethalness. From the smoothbore musket to the machine gun, sailing warships to dreadnaught battleships, horse-pulled artillery to
the atomic bomb, submarines under the seas and warplanes in the skies, to rockets and smart weapons, war rapidly evolved and continues to evolve today. This course will study
these developments, concentrating on conflicts like the Napoleonic wars, the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, with special emphasis upon the evolution of
military leaders like Napoleon, Grant and Lee, Moltke, Churchill and Roosevelt, Stalin and Hitler, Nelson and Doenitz, Eisenhower and MacArthur. Is it leadership that provides
the key to our understanding of modern warfare? Or is it technology? Or certain “timeless” military principles that transcend local historical contexts? Can history help us foresee
the future of warfare?
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on a substantial (no upper limit) research paper on a topic of the student’s choice, growing out of some aspect of the
course; participants will also, in teams of two or three, lead class discussion at least once, as well as give class reports on the course readings.

HIST 478(F) Cold War Landscapes (Same as AMST 478 and ENVI 478)
The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union set in motion dramatic changes to the natural and built environments of many nations between 1945 and 1991.
Nuclear test and missile launch sites, naval installations, military production operations, and border securitizations are just a few of the most obvious ways in which the stand-off
between the two countries altered rural and urban landscapes around the world. But one can also see the Cold War as setting in motion less immediately direct but nonetheless
profound changes to the way that many people saw and planned for the environments around them, as evidenced, for instance, by the rise of the American suburb, the reconstruction of postwar Europe, and agricultural and industrial initiatives in many developing nations. We will begin this seminar by exploring several distinct “Cold War landscapes” in
the United States, then move on to examining others in Europe and the Soviet Union. We will spend the final weeks of the semester discussing examples from other parts of the
world. Our approach to our topics will be interdisciplinary throughout the semester, and students are welcome to write their research papers on any geographical area of the
world.

HIST 481T(S) Love and Revolution in Africa (Same as AFR 481T) (W)
This tutorial interrogates how Africans fought to gain control over their individual and collective destinies in the face of oppressive colonial regimes, apartheid, and difficult
postcolonial conditions. The violence, but also the new possibilities that defined the 20th century, thoroughly transformed Africans’ understandings of themselves and views of
the world. Students will analyze how historians of Africa have historicized feelings, political passions, intimacies, and their relationships with politics. Students will also read
fiction and use films and written primary sources to develop their own reflections on the connections between the categories of love and revolution in Africa.

HIST 482T Fictions of African-American History (Same as AFR 4812T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course examines the form and function of African-American historical narratives with attention to written texts pertaining to the enslavement and freedom of African
Americans during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The lack of documentary material pertaining to this history has made the task of reading and interpreting African
American experience particularly challenging. By crossing generic and disciplinary boundaries, students will take up the task of reading African-American history while attending to the difficulties such a task raises. To do so, we will read both historical and fictional narratives that raise explicitly the problems of writing African-American history. In the
first part of the course, we will discuss selected texts (fiction, narrative, and historiography) from the antebellum era in order to schematize the literature of slavery. In the second
half of the course, we will take up the discourse of freedom that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. Readings will include works by Booker T. Washington, James Weldon
Johnson, Charles Chesnutt, Harriet Wilson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sutton Griggs. In addition, we will read historiography on African American slavery, freedom, and urbanization.

HIST 483T African Political Thought (Same as AFR 483T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political thought. This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial,
cultural, and economic exploitation, forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political action. Most members of this tradition also considered the
ways in which uneven power relations within African communities shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we will examine in this course drew on resources
as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social Democracy, Marxism, Black Consciousness, Negritude and Gender theory, yet each participated, at least
implicitly, in a common African intellectual project: the meaning of Africa and of being African.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; a student either will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay on the
assigned readings or be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner each week. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the biweekly papers and oral

HIST 484T Victorian Psychology (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Although the Victorian era has traditionally been considered a psycho-social model of emotional inhibition and sexual prudery, recent studies have demonstrated that this characterization grossly oversimplifies the attitudes toward emotional and sexual life held by Europeans and Americans in the second half of the nineteenth century. This tutorial will
investigate professional and popular ideas about human psychology during the Victorian era. We will attempt to define and understand what people thought and felt about
insanity, the unconscious, dreams, sexuality, the relationship between natural impulses and civilized society, child development, the psychological differences between men and
women, and the relationship between the physical and the psychical. The course will concentrate on the close reading and analysis of primary documents from the era.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in groups of two once a week. Every other week each student will present a paper of approximately 5-7 pages on a topic
determined by the instructor, due by 5 p.m. the day before the tutorial meeting; the other student will function as a critic of the paper presented, expected to be familiar with the
assigned reading.

HIST 485T Stalinist Terror and the New Man (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The Bolsheviks strove to engineer a new type of person—socially active, cultivated, healthy, enthusiastic, and ready to build socialism. The methods used and the results produced in the name of this goal included acts of monumental heroism and violence, narratives of human progress, and chronicles of arguably the most egregious human rights
violations of the 20th century. In this course we will look at the ways historians, memoirists, and filmmakers have approached the period known as Stalin’s Great Purge and Terror
(1936-1939), attempting to answer questions to do with culpability, meaning, commitment, belief and disguise, fear, and betrayal. Dualistic concepts and categories like state/society, resistance/collusion, and domination/submission have engendered much controversy among scholars applying them to a time when victims and perpetrators were difficult
to distinguish and often the same individuals. The course charts historical analyses and disputes around topics such as: the crimes of communism,“revolution from above,”
Stalin’s personality, popular participation in show trials, the family and everyday life during the Terror, Stalinist science, and Soviet subjectivity.

HIST 486T(F) The Pacific War in Japanese Historical Memory (Same as ASST 486T and JAPN 486T) (W)
Almost seven decades after Japan’s surrender, the enduring question of how to remember the Pacific War continues to provoke controversy both within Japan and between Japan,
South Korea, and China. This tutorial will explore how this difficult past has been remembered in postwar Japan, and how and why these memories have changed from 1945 to
the present. Our focus will be on certain sites of memory—museums, shrines, literature, textbooks, and films—and how they have expressed and shaped memories of various
aspects of the war from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to military comfort women and the Nanking massacre. Key issues include how various Japanese have
tried to make sense of death and personal sacrifice in the name of a lost war; the implications of Japan’s unique position as both perpetrator of wartime atrocities and victim of
atomic bombings; the relationship between memory and nationalism; and what it means to come to terms with pasts contested both within and between countries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; a student either will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay on the

HIST 487T(S) The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and Meaning (W)
1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany
invaded Poland, after 1941 the war became a truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as 1943 it still appeared that the Axis powers
might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan were occupied by the Allies, who were preparing to put the surviving Axis leaders
and generals on trial for war crimes. This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of World War II. What were the origins
of this central event of the twentieth century? How and why did the war begin? Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or events?
How did the Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different? Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human
responsibility and with the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not stop Hitler earlier? Who was to blame for the fall of France
and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the Allies adopt a policy of extensive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have happened? Could it have been
stopped? Did the Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were the war crime trials justified? By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general
course the war followed as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the most decisive and important aspects of the conflict. Students will also have grappled with the task of
systematically assessing what combinations of material and human factors can best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of the war. Students will also have dealt with
the problem of assessing the moral and ethical responsibility of those persons, organizations, and institutions involved in the war.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the
instructor. Students not presenting an essay have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in a final written exercise.

HIST 488T(S) Religion and Secularism in Modern Europe and Russia
The influence and fate of religion in modern Europe present a complex and contradictory pattern. Increased religious tolerance and pluralism have coexisted with intense anti–
clericalism, militant secularism, virulent anti–Semitism, and Islamophobia; religious revival and innovation have coexisted with skepticism, secularization, and dechristianization; both religion and irreligion have served as bases for political mobilization and powerfully shaped personal, national, and transnational identities. Demonstrating a long–term
trajectory toward secularity, Europe for some scholars reflects the inexorable process of modernization; other scholars reject this claim and contend that Europe’s experience is
unique in a global context. As evidence, some point to the apparent vitality of religion in imperial Russian and the revival of religious profession and identity in post–communist
Russia. This course will explore these differing perspectives on religion in modern Europe and Russia through an examination of selected aspects of the interrelationship between
religion and politics, the formation of imperial and national polities and identities, social and economic change, cultural developments, and gender.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: in alternate weeks, students will write an essay based on class readings and prepare a critique of their partner’s essay.

HIST 489T(F) Ideology, Culture, and Identity: The “New Diplomatic History”
This course explores a recent wave of historical scholarship on the roles of ideology, culture, and identity in American foreign relations. The proliferation of such studies has
contributed to the revival of the once moribund subfield of diplomatic history and restored it to the mainstream of the historical profession. Yet this “cultural turn” has not
come without controversy, as some traditional diplomatic historians insist that it dilutes the subfield and discourages young scholars from engaging in necessary research on
high-level diplomacy. Students will read several important “state of the field” essays alongside some of the most exciting contributions to this new trend and consider the
following questions: What do these new works add to our understanding of U.S. history and the history of the United States in the World? What roles do ideology, culture, and
identity play in the policymaking process? In what ways do these studies complement traditional diplomatic histories that privilege the study of power in the international
arena and to what extent are they a separate venture all together? What can “the new diplomatic history” contribute to other historical subfields and vice versa?

HIST 490T Memory, History, and the Extermination of the Jews of Europe: Dangerous History (Same as JWST 490T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War continue to trouble historians in their attempts to understand and represent them in all their magnitude
and horror. Beyond historians, the complicity of segments of European societies in perpetrating those atrocities continues to raise thorny questions for postwar European nations
about what their responsibilities are toward that past. This tutorial will focus on a series of questions relating to the historicization and memorialization of the extermination of
European Jews. They include: Is the Holocaust unique? Is it a Jewish story or universal story? Does the Holocaust raise different issues for the historian than other historical
events? How should the Holocaust be represented and what are the implications of different means of representing it? What role, if any, did European Jews play in their own
destruction? Has Germany faced up to its past? Were Germans also victims of World War II? Who were the “bystanders” as compared to the “perpetrators”? Were the postwar
trials of perpetrators a travesty of justice? How appropriate are the different uses that Israel and the United States have made of the Holocaust? By the end of the course, students
will have grappled with the ongoing controversies that have arisen among scholars, governments, and lay people about the meaning (and meaninglessness) of the Holocaust for
the postwar world. In a world in which extraordinary acts of violence continue to be perpetrated and more and more nations’ pasts are marked by episodes of extreme criminality
and/or trauma, exploring the manner by which one such episode has been remembered, avenged, and adjudicated should prove relevant for future consideration of other societies’ efforts to confront their own traumatic pasts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Class time consists of weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student. Every other week the student will write and present
orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings of that week. On alternate weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student’s paper. A final written exercise,
a thought piece on the issues raised in the tutorial, will cap off the semester’s work.
Prerequisite: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference give to History majors and Jewish Studies concentrators.

HIST 491T Political Islam: Past, Present, Future (Same as ARAB 491T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
Why have Islamist movements become so powerful in the last 30 years? What are their real political goals? Is political Islam a rejection of modernity, a reaction to Western
culture, or an ideology aimed at specific political objectives? Does the rise of political Islam herald an inevitable “clash of civilizations” with the West, or can Islam and the West
peacefully co-exist? Questions such as these have become increasingly urgent since September 11. This course will examine the emergence, development, and substantive
content of Islamist political movements in the twentieth century. The tutorial focuses upon the emergence of Islamist movements within distinctive political, economic, social and
cultural conditions in the Middle East. It will juxtapose analytical readings on specific states or aspects of the Islamic trend with the writings of Islamists and other primary
sources. We will look both at Islamist movements active in single states, the wider phenomenon of transnational Islamist politics, and the theoretical and philosophical issues
raised by the rise of Islamist movements, to consider both similarities and diversity in Islamic politics. The object of the course is to understand Islamist movements on their own
terms, and to be able to make informed judgments about the future of international politics. Because of its comparative approach and its concerns with power and privilege this
course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5- to 7-page essays or 2-page critiques due each week and a final report (3-4 pages) at the end of the semester.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to History majors and to those who have taken History 207 or other courses on the Middle East.

HIST 492T(S) Revolutionary Thought in Latin America (D) (W)
For much of Latin America’s postcolonial history, political and business elites in the United States have viewed the region as a source of revolutionary threats. Too often histories
of actual revolutionary movements and the ideas they promulgated have followed either the self-serving narratives that the revolutionaries have laid out or the similarly limited
stories composed by their opponents. This tutorial, by contrast, will delve into the complex, contingent, and at times counterintuitive history of revolutionary thought in modern
Latin America. Our readings and discussions will carry us from the nineteenth century to the rise of the “New Left” in the last few years. Throughout the course our principle goal
will be to examine the internal logic of the most influential programs of revolutionary thought as well as their relationship to circumstances external to them, both in their home

182

regions and globally. At the same time, we will consider the human or moral promise and price of revolutionary options: did the proposed or alleged aims of revolutionary ideals
justify the costs they would impose? This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by comparing and analyzing divergent theorizations of history
and society, as well as the contexts in which such theories emerged and to which we might or might not choose to apply them. A central aim of the course will be to compare the
formation of revolutionary initiatives across national and chronological boundaries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present a 5- to 7- page essay every other week on
the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner. Evaluation will be based on written
work and analysis of their partner’s work.
No prerequisites; open to all. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to History majors.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are
designed primarily to complement and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying related courses in other departments
will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and
technology relevant to many issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern science in the 1600s and 1700s,
and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it complements courses related to modern European history. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of
science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas,
practice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(F) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as SCST 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today’s society, and of the problems which technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to sciencetechnology studies. Topics include: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological society, e.g.,
computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-7 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference to first-years and sophomores.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF
D. BEAVER
HSCI 224 Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as HIST 294) (Not offered 2013-2014)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any, technical detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference
between propaganda and fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); Newton (1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also
treats briefly the emergence of modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our origins, our past, and our material structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to
form a new framework, and ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other sciences, other fields of thought, and in
society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, four short papers (3-5 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30. Open to first-year students. Preference to seniors and juniors.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement.
D. BEAVER
HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as HIST 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and inventors whose skills helped shape the United States’ response to the
Industrial Revolution. The interaction of science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the machine in the garden, through the
“American System of Manufactures” helped America rise to technological prominence; the professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to their becoming vital national resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American invention (1865-1914), forms the focus of this course: how science and
technology have helped shape modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (2-3 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Open to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

HSCI 320(F) History of Medicine (Same as HIST 293)
A study of the growth and development of medical thought and practice, together with consideration of its interaction with science and social forces and institutions. The course
aims at an appreciation of the socio-historical construction of Western medicine, from prehistory to the twentieth century. The course begins with paleomedical reconstructions,
and moves to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek [not only Hippocratic] medicine, Greek and Roman anatomy and physiology, Arabic medical thought, Renaissance medicine,
and the gradual professionalization and specialization of medicine from the sixteenth century. Attention is paid to theories of health and disease, ideas about anatomy and physiology, in addition to achievements such as anesthesia and internal surgery, and advances in instruments such as obstetrical forceps and the stethoscope.
Format: seminar. Requirements: six short papers (3 pages), midterm, final hour exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Open to first-year students.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES
(Div. II, with some exceptions as noted in course descriptions)
Chair, Professor PETER JUST
Advisory Committee: Professors: DARROW**, JUST, ZIMMERBERG***. Associate Professor: CRUZ. Assistant Professor: HAMMERSCHLAG.
This program is designed to facilitate and promote innovations in curricular offerings in relation both to interdisciplinary conceptual focus and experimental pedagogical form.
It provides support for faculty and student efforts to develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and modes of teaching/learning that currently fall outside
the conventional pattern.
EXPR 245 (Re)presenting Sex: Shakespeare on Page and Stage (Same as THEA 245 and WGSS 245) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This experimental course approaches the question of how sex and sexual identity are portrayed in Shakespeare from two different directions-close reading focused on the page
and acting centered on the stage. These two critical modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized fashion as separate, even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within the framework of a single, integrated course. The teaching method is to
bridge the gap between the two modes not by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between them. For example, no performance can include all the
possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been left out. Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative
suspension, the specifics of bodily movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings emerge when enacted are lost.
We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience the tension from both sides, to articulate the opportunities and
limits of each side, and to combine their respective strengths.
The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves as primarily “scholars” or “actors,” but some overlap will be
built in to ensure that “scholars” gain understanding of acting and “actors” gain access to scholarship. All students will be expected to demonstrate versatility in traversing the full
spectrum from interpretation through reading to interpretation through performance.
The specific topic that will bring these theoretical issues into focus is the matter of sex and sexual identity, as illuminated through the analysis of language, psychology, and
theatrical embodiment. Six plays will be studied in depth: The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Othello, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Winter’s Tale.
Format: lecture/discussion,with additional periods set aside for scene presentation. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, plus a final exam. All students will take the
final: “scholar” students will have rigorous expectations in the writing of papers; “actor” students will have intensive (graded) performance expectations.
No prerequisites; students wishing to enroll as Acting Students should consult with instructors. Enrollment limit: 15-20 (expected: 15).
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

INTR 252 The Human Image: Photographing People and Their Stories (Same as ARTS 252) (Not offered 2013-2014)
The single most photographed subject is the human form. The motivations and strategies for imaging faces and bodies, both individual and aggregate, are as varied as the subjects
themselves. In this course, we will examine some of the many approaches used to photograph people. We’ll start by exploring self-portraiture, and progress to photographing
others—both familiars and strangers, in the studio and in less controlled environments. We’ll end with a consideration of “documentary” photography and other visual narratives.
In each case, we’ll examine our reasons for making an image, and the methods available for achieving these goals. Thus, the class will have a significant technical component,
dealing with the creative use of camera controls, the properties and uses of light, and digital capture and processing. We will also examine the conceptual and scientific bases for
how we perceive and evaluate images. Students will initially use school-supplied digital cameras, and later have the option of using film. Lab fee: $100-150.
Format: studio/lecture. Requirements: students will be expected a) to photograph extensively outside of scheduled class hours b) to participate in class discussion and in both oral
and written critique, and c) to exhibit their work at the end of the semester.
Prerequisites: Students from all disciplines are welcome. Previous photography experience is desirable, but not essential. However, permission of the instructor is required.

INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
(Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor NGONIDZASHE MUNEMO
Advisory Committee: Professors: BERNHARDSSON, CAPRIO, CASSIDAY, CRANE, DARROW**, D. GOLLIN*, KUBLER, MAHON, MUTONGI*, A. V.
SWAMY***. Associate Professors: BANTA, MUNEMO.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises including environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment,
terrorism and pandemics, knowledge of the world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the Williams experience. Both within and
outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportunities to pursue that goal. The International Studies Program is designed to increase awareness of those opportunities and to provide a centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with perspectives that are cross disciplinary and comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study of one area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work
they have done in their majors. Students will be expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In addition to completing International
Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track including an approved senior exercise. Students may not count a course toward more than one track in the program.

TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone where several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second
type is organized thematically and will explore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by faculty teaching in that track in
consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional requirement of a level of language competency for its concentrators. Each track may also require one
of the elective courses to be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area, but would enrich the student’s experience with tools for
comparative inquiry. At present the program consists of the following tracks:

Area Tracks
African Studies
East Asian Studies
Latin American Studies
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies

Thematic Tracks
Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
Economic Development Studies
Urbanizing World

To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional approved courses within the track, attend the weekly International
Studies colloquium and complete a senior exercise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for many concentrators.

International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in their careers. These courses will usually be team taught. The topics and
regions covered will vary and be selective, but all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in conversation with one another to illustrate the
necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available to pursue an individual track. On occasion students may petition to substitute a course equivalent in scope to
International Studies 101 to meet this requirement.

Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The program in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of
Career Counseling will advise students on opportunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad program can be counted toward the five
elective courses requirement.

Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their senior year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams.
We hope that it will become a regular event for all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures and is designed to feature
faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide interest to those in International Studies.

Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25 pages) that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular area. It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in the context of a shared
seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would culminate in a public presentation by each concentrator of his/her work in class or in the context of
the International Studies Colloquium.

Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors
candidate must complete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent while enrolled in the senior thesis
course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to the courses required to fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration
of her/his junior year.

INST 101 Is the World Flat? An Introduction to International Studies (Not offered 2013-2014)
The economic, technological, political and cultural processes that have been gathered together under the term ‘globalization’ have been championed by many as the inevitable
face of the future of the world. Some have eloquently questioned the overlooked inequalities that arise from these processes, while still others have questioned the inevitability of
the processes that the term signals. This course will approach these issues with five sustained case studies that will attend especially to the areas of international trade in cotton and
textiles, economic development strategies in microfinance, global health focusing on controlling tuberculosis, democracy promotion with a focus on corruption and ethnic conflict and finally the ideology of intervention in the name of human rights. We will conclude then with a critical examination of the notion of ’globalization’ as an economic,
political, and cultural phenomenon as a way of thinking about the shape of the world in the coming decades.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on three 3- to 5-page response papers and one oral presentation and one final 8- to 10-page paper.

multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political
science or Asian studies is necessary.

INST 101(F) Small States in the International System (Same as PSCI 105) (D)
What is a “small state”? How do small states differ from large states? Can small states stand on their own or do they need political and economic shelter for larger states and/or
international institutions? The aim of the course is to provide a theoretical and practical understanding of the position of small states in the international system. It examines how
small states work within the international and regional institutions and their power potential within the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU). As a regional and
comparative case study, it analyzes in detail the participation of the Nordic states (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) in the UN and the European integration
process. What does the EU offer to small states in specific terms of survival, strategy and security? How can states exercise their powers within the EU? Do small states behave
differently from the large ones within the EU? The final part examines small states in the UN and determines the ability of them to influence the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC). It deals with how internal competence of small states in areas such as knowledge, initiative and diplomatic, coalition and leadership skills and their perceived neutrality.
At the end of the course students should have a good knowledge of the relevance of multi-lateral institutions to small states’ agendas and their strategic options; of the potential
influence of small states within the UN and the EU; and of the specific reactions of the Nordic states to globalization and the European integration process.

Winner of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize, the European Union is a political and economic union of 27 states that has had a transformative effect on the European continent. The
main aim of this introductory course is to provide an overview of the workings of the European Union (EU). Starting with its creation in post-war Europe, this course will then
consider its enlargement and the various challenges this growth has brought. Special attention will be given to the new Lisbon Treaty and how it is changing the decision-making
processes of the EU. The course will also evaluate how EU institutions function such as the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice and its main policies. Special
attention will be given the Union’s financial policy, especially the creation of the Union’s single currency, the Euro, and how the EU is responding and coping with the global
financial crisis. At the end of the course, students will have developed a comprehensive understanding of the history of the EU, its decision-making processes, and how it is
dealing with its present challenges.

Advisory Committee: Professor: GERRARD. Associate Professors: BERNHARDSSON, DEKEL, S. FOX, GARBARINI*. Assistant Professor: ISRAEL. Croghan
Bicentennial Visiting Professor: RAJAK.
THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the texts, history, languages, philosophy, and culture of Jews and Judaism as they have changed over three
millennia and throughout the world. The program offers courses in multiple disciplines including but not limited to Religion, Classics, History, Philosophy, Anthropology, Sociology, and Comparative Literature. Across these disciplines, the program examines topics such as religious belief and practice, textual interpretation, the development of
Zionism, life in the Diaspora, the historicization and memorialization of the Holocaust, and historical, political and philosophical questions surrounding Jewish identity. Investigating the foundations and development of these various Jewish topics, as well as their interaction with and influence on other traditions, provides an opportunity to explore the
continuities and diversity of Jewish life and thought. Students will gain exposure to a common body of knowledge and scholarly approaches through which to engage in their
own rich and varied intellectual explorations of Jewish and related topics.

CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies requires five courses with at least two different prefixes: one gateway course, two core courses, one elective, and one capstone course.
Senior concentrators should consult with the chair about arrangements for a capstone course.

Gateway Courses (can also count as core courses):

student will normally focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic relevant to Jewish Studies or approximately one-third of the course will be devoted to Jewish
subjects. The list of relevant electives changes regularly, so the course catalog should be checked for details. Listed below are examples of courses partially related to Jewish
Studies. Students may meet the elective requirement with a course not listed here, subject to the approval of the Chair of Jewish Studies.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN JEWISH STUDIES.
The degree with honors offers students the opportunity to undertake advanced research under the supervision of one or more of the faculty members in Jewish Studies.
Students normally must have at least a 3.5 GPA in the concentration and secure a faculty sponsor to be eligible. In addition to completing the five courses required for the
concentration, candidates must enroll in either JWST 493 and a Winter Study course or a Winter Study course and JWST 494 in their senior year, and prepare a substantial written
thesis. Honors in Jewish Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an honors thesis and is awarded an honors grade by her/his advisor and
one other faculty reader. Students interested in becoming candidates for honors should consult with the program in the spring of the junior year.

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan Bicentennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in
Judaism and/or Christianity. In Fall 2013, Professor Tessa Rajak, Professor Emerita of Ancient History at the University of Reading, will be teaching a course on Josephus and
Jewish history in the Roman period.

Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have spent a semester or year at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, or
the University of Haifa. With the approval of the Jewish Studies program chair, students may count a study-abroad program towards up to two core requirements.

Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman ’50, Samuel Bronfman II ’75, and Matthew Bronfman ’80. The Bronfman Fund
provides opportunities for the Williams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College’s formal curriculum and through the planning of major
events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener ’56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997 through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener ’56. The Wiener gifts have provided
an endowment to support a faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

JUSTICE AND LAW (Div. II)
Chair, Lecuturer in Humanities ALAN HIRSCH
Advisory Committee: Professors: GENTRY, KAPLAN, NOLAN, SHANKS. Associate Professor BARRY, DUBOW*. Assistant Professors CROWE, KNIBBS,
NJOYA §§.
Justice and Law is an interdepartmental program designed to give students a background in and frameworks for understanding the ways that philosophers, legislators, and
ordinary people think about justice, and the related ways in which societies marshal power to embed ideas about justice, as well as other concerns in law. This liberal arts program
provides tools to think and to argue critically about what justice might entail, how it works in practice, how rules, aspirations, laws, and norms evolve over time and in different
parts of the world, what compliance and enforcement mean, and what their relationship is to justice, conflict resolution, and legitimate authority.

THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Justice and Law consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory course, four electives taken from at least two departments—at least
one of the four electives should emphasize theories of justice and/or law and at least one historical enactment or application in institutions—and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic. Electives vary from year to year according to course offerings. Students may declare program concentrations at any point during their academic careers.

STUDY ABROAD
Students who choose to study abroad should consult with the program chair to insure that they can complete the requirements.

REQUIRED COURSES
JLST 101(F) Introduction to Justice and Law

This course will examine all aspects of America’s legal system, including its historical and constitutional underpinnings; the processes of resolving disputes, e.g., trials, plea-bargaining, and civil settlement; and the diverse roles of participants in the system, e.g., judges, jurors, legislators, and law schools. The course will emphasize the deeply interdisciplinary nature of law, probing the law’s intersections with politics, history, economics, psychology, philosophy, sociology, science, and religion.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two papers, a midterm, a final exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30). Preference given to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF
HIRSCH
JLST 401 Senior Seminar (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)

In 2013-2014, seniors may take either JLST 312 (Spring) OR JLST 377 (Fall) as their senior seminar.
JLST 312(S) Images of Law (Same as (COMP 316 and ENGL 332) (W)
Works of art transform how we view the law. Novels like Dickens’s Bleak House, Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Melville’s Billy Budd,
and Kafka’s The Trial produce indelible images that inspire sometimes haunting reflections about all phases of the legal process—investigation, interrogation, arrest, trial, and
punishment. Poems, paintings, and other art forms also offer perspectives on the law, raising issues richer and more elusive than what we encounter on Court TV, in the New York
Times, or even from sophisticated legal scholars. We will probe, among other things, the nature of justice, how a penal system acquires and maintains legitimacy, different modes
of fact-finding, and purposes of punishment. This course engages with works of art with the goal of gaining insight into law.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short writing assignments, three longer papers, class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to concentrators in the Justice and Law program.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF

GOTANDA

FOUR ELECTIVES
Four elective courses are required to complete a concentration in Justice and Law. These courses must be taken from at least two departments. At least one of the four electives
should emphasize theories of justice and/or law and at least one historical enactment or application in institutions. Other courses, not listed below, may be approved by the Chair.

ELECTIVES

Students can check with the department coordinator to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

JLST 250T(F) Trials
Humans are social creatures. In organized societies, when conflicts arise, people rely on the law and, within the law, on trials to sort out competing claims and assign proper
consequences. “Trials” include other tests such as the trial of battle, experimental trials, trials to qualify for athletic finals, and probationary periods. At it core, then, a trial is a way
to test the veracity or quality of some person or thing. This tutorial traces the application and various meanings of trials, focusing on three themes: trials as a test of personal

LATINA/O STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor C. ONDINE CHAVOYA
Advisory Committee: Professors: KITTLESON, WHALEN**. Associate Professors: CEPEDA***, RÚA. Assistant Professors: HIDALGO* , VARGAS. Visiting
Assistant Professor: HERNANDEZ. Gaius Charles Bolin Fellow in Latina/o Studies: ESCUDERO.
Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories, representations, and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States.
Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come from or whose ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program seeks to cover the widest
range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central and South
American countries. Courses, most of which use a comparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools to continue their work in areas of their particular interest.
Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in the United States, which is also one of the fastest growing populations in the contemporary era, provides an opportunity to
explore complex dynamics globally and within the context of the United States. The program examines topics such as the political and economic causes of migration, the impact
of globalization, economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and reformulations of identities and communities, the uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic
expression, aesthetics, and visual and popular culture.

THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introductory course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Honors in Latina/o Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is
awarded an honors grade by her/his advisor and two other faculty readers. In consultation with the advisor and the chair, faculty readers may be from outside the Latina/o Studies
Program.
The honors project will be completed over one semester plus winter study. It may consist of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other forms of presentation
(e.g., video, art, theater). It may also combine a shorter research thesis with another medium.
To be accepted as a candidate for honors in Latina/o Studies, a student must meet these criteria:
1) Submit and earn approval of a project proposal in April of the junior year. The proposal should be no longer than 5 pages and should lay out the project’s aim and
methodology, identify the student’s advisor for the work, and include evidence of competence in the necessary media for projects that include non-thesis forms.
2) Achieve a grade point average generally of at least 3.33 in LATS courses at the time of application.
Students admitted to the honors program must submit a 5-8 page revised proposal, with an annotated bibliography, by the second week of classes in the fall semester of her/his
senior year. They should register either for LATS 493 in the fall semester and LATS 031 in Winter Study, or for LATS 031 in Winter Study and LATS 494 in the spring semester.
These courses will be in addition to the 5 courses that make up the regular concentration.

STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad and other off-campus programs offer excellent opportunities for students to build on, and expand, the intellectual interests they develop as part of the Latina/o
Studies concentration. Through their connections to various institutions in the U.S. and other nations, Latina/o Studies faculty can help place students in U.S. borderlands programs as well as programs in Mexico, Cuba, and other “countries of origin.” Any student seeking to include courses as part of a concentration in Latina/o Studies should feel free
to contact the Program chair or other faculty. A maximum of 1 course taken away from Williams can count (as an elective) toward the completion of the concentration.
LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? At present, individuals living in the United States who are classified as such number approximately 40 million, constituting the country’s
largest “minority” group. In this course, we will study the interdisciplinary field that has emerged in response to this growing population, as we focus on the complex nature of
“identity.” Viewing identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assessment of how racial, ethnic, class, and gendered identities take shape in the
Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States, as we compare each group’s unique
history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a contested terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, the United States’ policymakers, the media, and
others seek to define the “newcomers” along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert, and express their own sense of identity. In this
light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these diverse expressions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national origins.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation and several short papers (1-5 pages) throughout the semester.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Required course for the concentration in Latina/o Studies. Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 WF
CHAVOYA and RÚA
LATS 203(S) Chicana/o Film and Video (Same as AMST 205, ARTH 203 and WGSS 203) (D)
Hollywood cinema has long been fascinated with the border between the United States and Mexico. This course will examine representations of the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican Americans, and Chicana/os in both Hollywood film and independent media. We will consider how positions on nationalism, race, gender, identity, migration, and history are
represented and negotiated through film. We will begin by analyzing Hollywood “border” and gang films before approaching Chicana/o-produced features, independent narratives, and experimental work. This course will explore issues of film and ideology, genre and representation, nationalist resistance and feminist critiques, queer theory and the
performative aspects of identity. Through a focus on Chicana/o representation, the course explores a wide spectrum of film history (from the silent era to the present) and considers numerous genres. By introducing various interdisciplinary approaches and theoretical methods related to race, representation, and the media, the course fulfills the Exploring
Diversity Initiative’s themes of critical theorization and power and privilege.
Format: film screenings will be scheduled as a lab. Evaluation will be based on one short paper, mid-term exam, final exam and take home essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 WF
Lab: 7:00-9:40 p.m. M

LATS 206(S) Cycle of Socialization: Understanding Similarities, Bridging Differences (D)
This course offers an overview of social identity development theories, social & cultural diversity, and societal manifestations of power, privilege and oppression within American society. How do the groups you belong to impact your life experiences (do they)? Are we predisposed to being in conflict or can diverse peoples form a harmonious community? We will identify the tools and strategies that social scientists, activists, and educators have employed in order to bridge the gaps across our differences. Topics include: race,
ethnicity and racism; social class and classism; sex, gender and sexism; and sexual orientation. This course is designed to provide students the opportunity to relate their own life
experiences to social science theories, research, and practice. Theorists whose work we will read include Beverly Tatum, Gordon Allport, Urie Bronfebrenner, bell hooks, Peggy
Mcintosh, Claude Steel, and many others.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers, final paper or project, and active participation in class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR

LATS 208(F) Introduction to Latina/o Literatures (Same as AMST 207 and COMP 211) (D)
This discussion course serves as an introduction; the reading list is not meant to be exhaustive or comprehensive, but will rather provide a sampling or range of texts for students
to engage. We will explore a number of readings across different genres (the novel, play, poem, short story, graphic novel). Students will endeavor to understand how each author
defines Latinidad. What characterizes Latina/os for each of these writers and how do their works articulate the historical conditions out of which they emerge? How is Latina/o
literature marked by notions of language, nationality, gender, sexuality, class, race, politics, form, and genre? The readings will provide both a survey of general ideas in the study
of Latina/o literatures as well as specific case studies and historical examples from which we will extrapolate about the larger field. Readings include works by Tómas Rivera,
Cristina García, Cristy C. Road, Oscar Zeta Acosta, Junot Díaz, Alisa Valdes–Rodriguez, and more. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirements as it
offers students a comparative study of cultures and societies by examining the U.S. racial project of constructing a Latina/o people out of various peoples. Additional attention is
given, under the rubric of power and privilege, to the specific economic and political institutions that structure Latina/o cultural production.
Format: lecture. Requirements: students will be evaluated based on weekly online discussion forum posts, two short papers, a midterm exam, a final comprehensive project, as
well as classroom participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators, American Studies and Comparative Literature majors .
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Hour: 1:10–2:25 MR
HERNÁNDEZ
LATS 209 Spanish for Heritage Speakers: Introduction to Latina/o Cultural Production (Same as RLSP 209) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This lecture and discussion course focuses on the acquisition and improvement of critical communication and analytical skills in Spanish for use both in and outside of the United
States. We address all four of the primary language skills (listening, reading, writing, and speaking), with particular attention to the unique needs of students who have received a
majority of their exposure to the Spanish language in an informal/domestic environment. Through the use of materials and vocabulary taken from a variety of real-life contexts,
but with primary emphasis on the diverse U.S. Latina/o communities, this course aims to sharpen heritage speakers’ sociolinguistic competency and ability to interpret musical,
cinematic, and literary texts in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Evaluation to be based on student participation, grammar homework, 2 oral exams, and 3-4 written essays.
No prerequisites, however, students who have completed the majority of their formal education in a Spanish-speaking country are not permitted to enroll in this course without
prior permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators or Spanish majors by seniority.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis..
CEPEDA
LATS 220(F) Introduction to Urban Studies: Shaping and Living the City (Same as AMST 221 and ENVI 221)
Generally, cities have been described either as vibrant commercial and cultural centers or as violent and decaying urban slums. In an effort to begin to think more critically about
cities, this course introduces important topics in the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies. Specifically, we will discuss concepts and theories used to examine the peoples and
structures that make up cities: In what ways do socio–cultural, economic, and political factors affect urban life and development? How are cities planned and used by various
stakeholders (politicians, developers, businesses, and residents)? How do people make meaning of the places they inhabit? We will pay particular attention to the roles of race,
ethnicity, class, and gender in understanding and interpreting urban communities. Texts include works by anthropologists, historians, sociologists, cultural critics, cultural geographers, and literary writers
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance and class participation, several short writing assignments (1–2 pages), two creative group projects and presentations, a midterm essay (5-7 pages) and final essay (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to first and second year students as well as American Studies majors and Latina/o Studies concentrators.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

LATS 224 U.S. Latina/o Religions (Same as AMST 224 and REL 224) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
In this course, we will engage aspects of Latina/o religious experiences, practices, and expressions in the United States of America. Some attention will be given to historical
contexts in Iberia and Latin America, as well as questions of how one studies Latina/o religions. Most of the course, however, will examine moments where religious expressions
intersect with politics, popular culture, and daily life in the U.S.A. Given the plurality of Latina/o communities and religious lives in the U.S.A., we will engage certain selected
religious traditions and practices by focusing on particular moments of religious expression as elucidated in specific historiographies, ethnographies, art, literature, and film.
Rooting ourselves in the social, political, cultural, and historical contexts in which particular Latina/o religious formations arose, this Exploring Diversity Initiative course also
examines issues of social and institutional power relations that influence particular religious formations.
Format: discussion. Evaluation: based upon class participation, short writing exercises, a 5- to 8-page take-home midterm essay, and a 10- to 15-page final review essay.
No prerequisites; open to first year students. Enrollment limit: none (expected 15).

LATS 240 Latina/o Language Politics: Hybrid Voices (Same as AMST 240 and COMP 210) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
In this course we will focus on issues of language and identity in the contemporary lived experience of various U.S. Latina/o communities. We will ask: How are cultural values
and material conditions expressed through Latina/o linguistic practices? How do Latina/o identities challenge traditional notions of the relationship between language, culture,
and nation? In what ways might Latina/o linguistic practices serve as tools for social change? Building on a discussion of issues such as Standard American English, codeswitching (popularly known as “Spanglish”), and Latina/o English, we will also examine bilingual education, recent linguistic legislation, and the English Only movement. We
will survey texts taken from a variety of (inter)disciplines, including sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, literature, and education. Both directly and/or indirectly, these
works address Latina/o language politics, as well as the broader themes of power, community, ethno-racial identity, gender, sexuality, class, and hybridity.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators, American Studies majors, Comparative Literature majors by seniority.

LATS 258 Latina/o Installation and Site-Specific Art (Same as ARTH 258) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will explore the various forms of installation and site-specific artworks created by Latina/o artists for both museums and public space. We will examine the ways in
which Latina/o artists have used space as a material in the production of artworks and how this impacts the works’ meanings and the viewer’s experience. Within the context of
U.S. Latina/o culture and history, we will connect notions of space with ideas about cultural citizenship, civil rights, and social justice. A variety of art forms will be studied, from
traditional to experimental, including murals, sculpture, performance, video, and several multimedia, interactive, or participatory projects. While establishing a historical lineage
and theoretical frameworks for analyzing this growing genre, we will pay particular attention to how these works engage urban space and often challenge the institutional
assumptions of museums and curatorial practice. Likewise, we will examine the important debates associated with various public art and museum installation controversies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, periodic research reports, final research paper, and presentation.
Prerequisites: LATS 105 or ARTH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Core elective for Latina/o Studies concentration. Preference to

LATS 312 Chicago (Same as AMST 312 and ENVI 313) (Not offered 2013-2014)
“The city of big shoulders has plenty of room for diversity,” reads the official visitor’s website for the City of Chicago. Focusing on this claim, this course asks students to think
critically about what kind room has been made for diversity—social, spatial, and ideological. Additionally we examine the ways in which diverse social actors have shouldered
their way into the imagined and physical landscape of the city. Working with ethnography, history, literature, critical essays, and popular culture, we will explore the material and
discursive constructions of Chi-Town and urban life among its residents. Appreciating these constructions we also consider how Chicago has served as a key site for understandings of urbanity within a broader national and global context.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance and class participation, group presentations and discussions, 5 critical briefs ( 2-pages) and a book review essay
(12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Core elective for Latina/o Studies concentration. Preference given to American Studies majors, Latina/o Studies concentrators, and students who have taken LATS 220/AMST 221/ENVI 221.

LATS 313(F) Gender, Race, Beauty, and Power in the Age of Transnational Media (Same as AMST 313 and WGSS 313) (D)
This lecture and discussion course focuses on the politics of personal style among U.S. women of color in an era of viral video clips, the 24-hour news cycle, and e-commerce
sites dedicated to the dermatological concerns of “minority” females. With a comparative, transnational emphasis on the ways in which gender, sexuality, ethno-racial identity,
and class inform standards of beauty, we will examine a variety of materials ranging from documentary films, commercial websites, poetry and sociological case studies to
feminist theory. Departing from the assumption that personal aesthetics are intimately tied to issues of power and privilege, we will engage the following questions: What are the
everyday functions of personal style among women of color? Is it feasible to assert that an easily identifiable “African-American,” “Latina,” or “Asian-American” female aesthetic exists? What role do transnational media play in the development and circulation of popular aesthetic forms? How might the belief in personal style as a tactic of resistance
challenge traditional understandings of what it means to be a “feminist” in the first place?
Fornat: seminar. Evaluation to be based on student participation, one student-led discussion period, and two essays of 5-7 pages each.
Prerequisites: LATS 105, AFR 200, AMST 201, WGST 101 or permission of the instructor; first year students are not permitted to take this course. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators, American Studies majors, Africana Studies concentrators, and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies majors

LATS 318 (formerly 308) California: Myths, Peoples, Places (Same as AMST 318, COMP 328, ENVI 318 and REL 318) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
“Now I wish you to know about the strangest thing ever found anywhere in written texts or in human memory...I tell you that on the right-hand side of the Indies there was an
island called California, which was very close to the region of the Earthly Paradise.” As far as we know, the name “California” was first written in this passage by Garcí
Rodríguez de Montalvo, ca. 1510. Within a few decades, it came to be placed first on the peninsula of Baja California and then upon a region stretching up the Western coast of
North America. What aspects of this vision are still drawn upon in how we imagine California today? How did certain narratives of California come to be, who has imagined
California in certain ways, and why? What is the relationship between certain myths, the peoples who have imagined them, and the other peoples who have shared California
dreams? In this course, we will examine some of the myths that surround California by looking at a few specific moments of interaction between the peoples who have come to
make California home and the specific places in which they have interacted with each other. Of special interest will be imaginations of the Spanish missions, the Gold Rush,
agricultural California, wilderness California, California as “sprawling multicultural dystopia,” and California as “west of the west.”
Format: seminar. Requirements: this course will be mostly discussion oriented, with grading based upon participation, short writing exercises, one 3-page review essay, one 5- to
8-page midterm review essay, and a final 10- to 15-page comparative review essay.

LATS 330 Connective Approaches to Race, Ethnicity, and Diaspora (Same as AMST 330) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course explores the overlapping, intersecting, and intertwined experiences of distinct enthoracial communities in the United States. Students will investigate these experiences from a relational and connective point of view to tease out the contested meanings of nation, citizenship, community, rights, and struggle. For example, we will examine the
1947 school desegregation case involving Mexican Americans in California, Mendez v. Westminster, and its relationship to African American civil rights, Puerto Rican migration, and Japanese internment. Mendez v. Westminster, when approached from a connective perspective, reveals a multiracial and diasporic landscape that is more complex than
previously considered. A connective approach to Race, Ethnicity, and Diaspora allows us to uncover important episodes of collaboration and tension that have been rendered

193

invisible when studied independently. Working with ethnography, history, literature, critical essays, visual culture, and popular culture, this course focuses on the complicated
bonds among multiracial constituencies and potential future forms of collaboration.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on attendance, class participation, writing/discussion exercises, short papers, and a final project.
Prerequisites: course work in American Studies and/or Latina/o Studies, or consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 16). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators and American Studies majors.

LATS 338(F) Latina/o Musical Cultures: Gender, Race, Sexuality and the Dynamics of the Everyday (Same as AMST 339 and WGSS 338) (W) (D)
In this class we will investigate Latina/o popular musical and dance forms, with particular emphasis on questions of gender, sexuality, and ethno-racial identity. We will focus on
the following questions, among others: How are the various facets of Latina/o identity expressed through the“popular” or the everyday? In what ways do categories of difference
such as gender, sexuality, and ethno-racial identity inform the performance as well as the interpretation of Latina/o musical forms? How are we to understand cultural phenomenon such as the most recent Latin music “boom”? Employing cultural studies concepts and methods, students will conduct an original semester-long research project in stages
and complete one ethnographic exercise.
Prerequisites: prior courses in American Studies, Latina/o Studies, or Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; not open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected:
12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators,Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies majors and American Studies majors by seniority.

LATS 346 Latinas/os and the Media: From Production to Consumption (Same as AMST 346) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
This interdisciplinary lecture and discussion course centers on advertising, print media, radio, internet, television programming, and audience studies for, by, and about Latinas/
os. How do Latinas/os construct identity (and have their identities constructed for them) through domestic and transnational media outlets? How are Latina/o stereotypes
constructed, reflected, and ultimately circulated via mass media? Where do issues of consumer agency come into play? How might media provide a means for affecting social
change? And finally, which research methodologies best capture the complex relationship between consumer, producer, and media text? Readings include works by scholars
including Mari Castañeda, Dolores Inés Casillas, Arlene Dávila, Isabel Molina-Guzmán, Yeidy Rivero, América Rodríguez, and Angharad Valdivia, among others.

LATS 382 Latina/o Politics (Same as HIST 382 and WGSS 382) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course explores Latina/o politics from World War II to the present. Defining politics broadly, we will examine everything from electoral politics to grassroots activism. We
will explore the relationship between Latinas/os and the U.S. political system, as well as the ways in which dynamics internal to Latina/o communities shape political issues and
political participation. Specific topics include Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans struggles for political inclusion in the aftermath of World War II, Cuban exile politics and
their impact, the political and social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, key electoral campaigns, the recent appointment in 2008 of the first Latina as a Supreme Court justice,
and on-going debates over immigration. With an assessment of power relations at its core, this Exploring Diversity Initiative course explores the ways in which Latinos and
Latinas have been excluded from or differentially included in the U.S. political system, as well as how the U.S. political system reflects dominant hierarchies of race, class, and
gender. We will also interrogate how Latinas/os have sought to make U.S. politics more inclusive and at times have struggled to transform U.S. politics.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation including short assignments in preparation for discussion; three short essays based on course readings (3-5
pages each); and a final paper (7-10 pages).

LATS 405 Home and Belonging: Displacements, Relocations, and Place-Making (Same as AMST 405) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W) (D)
The metaphor of “home” and idea of “belonging” bring insight to theories and investigations centered on community building and identity formation within and across national
borders. These constructions give us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our objective in this course is to
interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and nations are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed
place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir,
literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in “rooting” migrating
subjects in place and time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American and West Indian festive
forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States,
focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, annotated bibliography, short essay (5 pages), writing workshop participation (and related assignments), research paper related assignments, and a final research paper (20-25 pages) and presentation.
Prerequisites: prior courses in Latino Studies, American Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 15). Preference given to senior Latino Studies concentrators and American Studies majors.

LATS 408(S) Envisioning Urban Life: Objects, Subjects, and Everyday People (Same as AMST 408) (W) (D)
What is the relationship between real life in urban communities and the multiple ways in which they are imagined? What does it mean to be “urban,” to live in an “urban
community,” or to be the product of an “urban environment”? Who do we think the people are who populate these spaces? This course takes a critical look at specific populations, periods, and problems that have come to dominate and characterize our conceptions of the quality, form, and function of U.S. urban life. A few of the topics we may cover
include historical accounts of the varied ways in which poverty and “urban culture” have been studied; race, class, and housing; the spatial practices of urban youth and the urban
elderly; and gendered perspectives on social mobility and community activism. Finally, this course will explore how diverse social actors negotiate responses to their socio-spatial and economic circumstances, and, in the process, help envision and create different dimensions of the urban experience. The course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative
requirement as it explores how various forms of urban inequality affect the collective experience of social actors in diverse race and class categories. It focuses on the complex
and contradictory ways in which urban residents confront, negotiate, and at times challenge social and structural inequalities and the changing political economy of U.S. cities.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short essays, a series of writing exercises, and a semester-long final project.
Prerequisites: prior courses in American Studies, Latina/o Studies, or permission of instructor; not open to first year students. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). Preference

LATS 409 Transnational Lives in Global Context (Same as AMST 411) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
In the age of satellite television, e-mail, and readily available international phone cards, transnationalism has rapidly become the norm as opposed to the exception. However,
what does it really mean to ”be transnational”? How do the lived experiences of transnational individuals and communities merge with (and differ from) theoretical notions of the
transnational? How do the practices and concepts of diaspora, globalization, and transnationalism compare? How does the growing number of transnational citizens and residents in this country shape ”American” identity on the local, national, and global scales? In this interdisciplinary, comparative course we will analyze contemporary theories
regarding the origins and impacts of transnationalism, key critiques regarding the field of transnational studies itself, and transnationalism’s role in the ”New” American Studies.
Case studies examined in this course include China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Syria.

LATS 412(F) Latina/o Collectivities: Family, Community, Nation (Same as AMST 412) (D)
This seminar will interrogate the three scales of belonging and un–belonging that are the family, the community, and the nation. Each of these, as social constructions, are sights of
contestation and cooperation. Students endeavor to understand the everyday identifications made by the Latina/o subject through these scales. The central questions of the course
will be: How has the family, the community, and the nation been utilized by Latina/o subjects and towards what ends? What are the social, political, economic, and affective
possibilities and limitations within such practices of belonging? How do these possibilities and limitations emerge within the Latina/o condition? What alternative modes of
Latina/o social belonging and/or political collectivity can we imagine? As a senior seminar, emphasis will be placed on students generating and leading discussion of a range of
both foundational texts as well as current monographs. Readings will include primary writings from José Martí, José Vasconcelos, and Elizabeth Martínez; theoretical foundations from Benedict Anderson, Miranda Joseph, Kath Weston, Paul Gilroy, Patricia Hill Collins, and Friedrich Engels; and contemporary, critical Latina/o scholarship with an
emphasis on literary, sociological, and cultural analyses from Richard T. Rodriguez, Marisel C. Moreno, Gilda L. Ochoa, and David J. Vázquez. This course will be of particular
interest and use to those students engaged with Latina/o Studies, American Studies, Literary Studies, and/or Queer Theory. It also falls under the critical theorization theme for
the Exploring Diversity Initiative through its comparative analysis of collectivities across differences within and beyond Latina/o peoples.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will be evaluated based on weekly write–ups on the readings, co–leading discussion twice during the semester, participation, and a final
seminar paper.

Since the 1970s, policymakers, scholars, the media, and popular discourses have used the umbrella terms “Hispanic” and “Latina/o” to refer to Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans,
Dominicans and more recent immigrants from Central and South American countries. As a form of racial/ethnic categorization, however, these umbrella terms can mask widely
divergent migration histories and experiences in the United States. In this course, we develop theoretical perspectives and comparative analyses to untangle a complicated web of
similarities and differences among Latino groups. How important were their time of arrival and region of settlement? How do we explain differences in socioeconomic status?
How fruitful and appropriate are comparative analyses with other racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans or European immigrants? Along the way, we explore the
emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study, as well as methods used in Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government
documents, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches. In this EDI course, we ask whether the history and processes of racialization in the United States has created similarities and/or differences in each group’s experiences, and to what extent the field of Latina/o Studies offers an alternative to racial biases embedded in the dominant academic
discourses.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentations, a proposal, an annotated bibliography, a short historiographical essay, and a research paper based in part on primary sources.

Advisory Committee: Professors: DUNN, MCALLISTER***, WOOD. Associate Professors: BERNHARDSSON, MELLOW***. Assistant Professors: CROWE,

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social
contexts-whether in a family, a team, a theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It seeks to understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority, power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and followers grant, in
all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are addressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined
leadership and what are the bases of leaders’ legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge? Through tradition, charisma, or legal
sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different historical contexts? What are
the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical challenges to established leadership in different historical contexts? How does one analyze the
experiences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of why history judges some leaders great and others failures? How and
why do these evaluations about the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete one of the two sequences outlined below (6 courses total).

LEAD 125(F) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies (Same as PSCI 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli have struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are
necessary for effective leadership. Social scientists throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about leadership in the areas of economics,
psychology, and sociology, among others. Nevertheless, despite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of leadership remains a contested field of study precisely
because universal answers to the major questions in leadership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed to introduce students to many of the central issues and
debates in the area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation and several brief (1 page) response papers, a short mid-term paper, and a longer final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

In the late-eighteenth century, two revolutions burst forth-they were the most striking and consequential events in modern history, decisive turning-points that transformed society
and politics. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the overarching ideas and visions of the sister revolutions. Through correspondence, political essays
and speeches, we will seek to understand the fundamental theories, goals and accomplishments of both revolutions. Who were their leaders and according to what principles did

196

they govern? Did revolutionaries in France find a model in America for their Revolution? What is the meaning of the “Terror” in France and what light does it shed on modern
revolutionary movements? Why was the American Revolution followed by decades of stability while the French Revolution bequeathed a turbulent succession of failed governments? Have America and France continued to conceive of themselves as revolutionary nations? We will read works by Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams,
Rousseau, Robespierre, Saint-Just, Tocqueville, Burke and others..
Format: seminar. Requirements: two papers, several class presentations, and active participation in class discussions.

LEAD 250(S) Political Leadership (Same as PSCI 205)
This course will examine the leadership strategies of American political leaders with an emphasis on the importance of communication strategies for public sector leaders. We
will study these issues by examining local, state and federal political leaders and by answering key questions specific to the political realm. We will read and watch significant
speeches of American political leaders, be visited by guests with deep knowledge and insight into the world of politics and read a variety of writings by academics and practitioners on the subject. We will explore questions such as “What characteristics mark successful communication and how do leaders craft a unique and effective communications
style?” and “What strategic considerations are there for female political leaders and do they have different challenges in communicating?”
The first series of classes will focus on communication—taking a look at some of America’s best political orators, the special requirements of crisis communication and the
changes that new media has brought to the practice of politics and government. We will then explore the tenets of political strategy— both in campaigns and governing. This
segment of the course will take a look at the tools used in crafting a strategy and how to put together a winning coalition. The final classes in the course will explore the unique
challenges and opportunities facing select sub-groups of political leaders: women, celebrity candidates and officeholders and high-achieving young political leaders—operatives
and elected officials.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three short papers and a final research paper.

LEAD 285(F) The Revolutionary Generation: Galaxy of Leaders (Same as HIST 354 and PSCI 285)
The American Revolution produced a galaxy of brilliant politicians and statesmen of extraordinary courage, intellect, creativity, and character. They succeeded in drafting an
unparalleled Constitution and establishing enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the wrenching issue of slavery and the rights of
women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and political leadership of these men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of their day: Washington, Madison,
Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as the correspondence between Madison and Jefferson and between Adams and Jefferson,
and Madison’s and Hamilton’s Federalist essays. We will also read recent interpretations of the founding generation by Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, Bernard Bailyn, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two papers and four class presentations.
No prerequisites; courses in Leadership Studies or Political Theory or early American History are very helpful for admission to this seminar. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

DUNN
LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are they one and the same? If different, what are the key elements making
each successful, and are there any critical dynamics or interdependencies among these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions between the factors required for success
by leaders/managers in different domains or cultures, and by leaders/managers of different genders or ethnicities? In this course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both successful and unsuccessful leadership and management of complex organizations in a number of domains, including the worlds of business, non-profits, higher education, the military, government, and others. Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies, supplemented by readings from noted leadership and management
thinkers, and by the appearance of several distinguished guest speakers.
Format: seminar for the first half of the course and tutorial for the second half. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less) response
papers, a short midterm paper, and a longer final paper, which will be written by a team of two students during the tutorial portion of the course. The final paper will focus on two
cases of each team’s choice.

In this course we will study the lives, ideas, visions and, above all, the political and moral leadership of Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The three Roosevelts transformed the role of government in American society, bringing about fundamental and lasting change. What were their leadership strategies and styles? Did they mobilize followers or did their followers mobilize them? How did they balance political compromise with bold, principled leadership? How did their personalities affect their visions and their
goals? To what extent did they offer ethical and moral leadership? In addition to studying histories and biographies, we will do extensive research in primary source material.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on participation in class discussions, oral reports, two research papers.

MARITIME STUDIES
Chair, Professor RÓNADH COX
Advisory Committee: Professor: ART*, COX. Associate Professor: TING. Assistant Professor: GILBERT. Associate Dean: GERRY.
Understanding the oceans and our interactions with them is of increasing importance in this era of climate change, sea-level rise, fisheries crises, and the internationalization of
the high seas. We encourage students to investigate our WaterWorld from the perspectives of the humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences. Maritime Studies is an
interdisciplinary, cross-divisional program that includes the literature, history, policy issues, and science of the ocean. Candidates for the concentration in Maritime Studies must
complete a minimum of seven courses: the interdisciplinary introductory course (Geosciences 104 Oceanography), four intermediate core courses (at Williams-Mystic), an
elective, and the senior seminar.
Students who have completed other study-away programs that emphasize marine studies should consult with the program chair about the possibility of completing the Maritime Studies concentration.

REQUIRED COURSES:
Introductory course:
Maritime Studies 104(S) Oceanography
Core courses (Williams-Mystic at Mystic Seaport):
MAST 231(F,S) Literature of the Sea
MAST 311(F,S) Marine Ecology
MAST 351(F,S) Marine Policy
MAST 352(F,S) America and the Sea, 1600-Present1
(NOTE: Students who take Maritime Studies 211 Oceanographic Processes at Mystic can substitute an extra elective in lieu of Geosciences 104)
Senior seminar:
MAST 402(F) Senior Seminar: Perspectives on Environmental Studies (Same as Environmental Studies 402)

Students can check with the department coordinator to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.
ELECTIVE COURSES:

Elective courses are listed based on either a clear maritime statement in the course description or broad practical/theoretical applicability to maritime studies. Concentrators
will take a minimum of one course from the list below. If concentrators find other courses in the catalog that they believe meet the requirements for a MAST elective, they may
bring them to the attention of the chair.

HONORS PROGRAM IN MARITIME STUDIES
Candidates for honors in Maritime Studies will complete a thesis in their senior year. The project will involve original research (archive, museum, field, or laboratory) followed by on-campus analysis and writeup of results. This could be either a one-semester project, or a full year (two semesters plus winter study). In either case, data collection
during the summer before the senior year may be necessary. In some cases, the thesis project may be a continuation and expansion of the student’s Williams-Mystic research
project. Honors will be awarded if the thesis shows a high degree of scholarship, originality, and intellectual insight.

MAST 231(F,S) Literature of the Sea (Same as ENGL 231) (Offered only at Mystic Seaport.) (W)
Taking advantage of our maritime museum, coastal setting, and three field seminars, we study canonical and lesser-known American novelists, travel writers, and poets who set
their works in the watery world, often in the exact places where we travel as a class. We read, for example—depending on fall or spring semester—Hemingway when sailing on
the Straits of Florida, Steinbeck when exploring Cannery Row on Monterey Bay, and Twain on a steamboat on the Mississippi. We read Rachel Carson beside the Mystic River
estuary, Chopin on the sands of the Gulf of Mexico, Kipling out on Georges Bank, and Melville’s masterpiece Moby-Dick aboard Mystic Seaport’s historic whaleship, the
Charles W. Morgan, a vessel nearly identical to the vessel he climbed aboard at age twenty-one. In the classroom we examine these works through a mixture of lecture, smallgroup discussion, and formal and creative writing. To further appreciation and analysis, this interdisciplinary course uses students’ emerging knowledge of maritime history and
marine science. Other authors and poets include, depending on fall or spring: Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Walt Whitman, Jack London, Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Langston
Hughes, Elizabeth Bishop, Frederick Douglass, Timothy Egan, and Ursula K. Le Guin. This course is offered off campus and is open to anyone.

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a variety of areas of mathematics and statistics,
and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching students to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning. Mathematics is a gateway to many career paths including
statistics, teaching, consulting, business, engineering, finance, actuarial studies and applied mathematics. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with the department faculty
on choosing courses appropriate to an individualized program of study.

REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
The major in Mathematics consists of nine courses plus the colloquium requirement. Mathematics is highly cumulative, and students should plan a
route to completing the major that ensures the proper sequencing and prerequisites for all needed courses. Note that not all upper level courses are
offered every year.

Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 140 (formerly 104) Calculus II
Mathematics 150 (formerly 105) or 151 (formerly 106) Multivariable Calculus
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
Mathematics 209 Differential Equations or
Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210) or
Mathematics 200 (formerly 251) Discrete Mathematics or
Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis or
Statistics 231 Statistical Design of Experiments or
a more advanced applied/discrete/statistics course with prior department approval
Core Courses (three courses)
Mathematics 250 (formerly 211) Linear Algebra
Mathematics 350 (formerly 301) Real Analysis or Mathematics 351 (formerly 305) Applied Real Analysis
Mathematics 355 (formerly 312) Abstract Algebra
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above, or STAT 231.
Any 400-level course taken in the senior year (excluding thesis work).
Participation in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present and attend talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice. Majors have
to attend at least 20 colloquia in their senior year and present one themselves.
Advanced Placement: Students who come to Williams with advanced placement will be moved up in the Mathematics major, and should consult with
faculty to be placed in the best class reflecting their experience and background. A student who places out of a course substitutes another course numbered 200 or
above in Mathematics or Statistics to complete the nine course major. Students should select courses best suited to their preparation and goals, and consult with the
department faculty concerning appropriate courses and placement. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is
overqualified.
CALCULUS PLACEMENT
Recommended placement for students who have taken an Advanced Placement Examination in Calculus (AB or BC) is
BC 1, 2 or AB 2, 3 Math 140 (formerly 104)
AB 4 or 5 Math 150 (formerly 105)
BC 3, 4 or 5 Math 151 (formerly 106)
Consult with department faculty for any Calculus or Statistics placement questions. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not
they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from 130 (formerly 103) unless they obtain permission from the instructor.
NOTES
Substitutions, Study Abroad, and Transfer Credit: In some cases, and with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department,
appropriate courses from other institutions or a course from another Williams department may be substituted for electives. Programs like the
“Budapest Semester in Mathematics” are recommended for majors who wish to focus on mathematics away. The department, though, normally
accommodates students who select other study away programs. The department offers its core courses in both the fall and the spring to allow students to spend
more easily a semester away.
Double Counting: No course may count towards two different majors.
Early Senior Seminar: In exceptional circumstances, with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior Major Course
requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed at least three 300-level mathematics courses before enrolling in the Senior Major
Course.
Planning Courses: Core courses Mathematics 350 (formerly 301), 351 (formerly 305), 355 (formerly 312), and Statistics 346 are normally offered every year.
Most other 300-level topics are offered in alternate years. Topology, Complex Analysis, and second courses in real analysis and abstract algebra are normally

200

offered at least every other year.
Each 400-level topic is normally offered every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission: Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites, subject to any course caps. Students with questions about the level at
which courses are conducted are invited to consult department faculty.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which
extends beyond the requirements of the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mastery of core
material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics,
originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters (MATH/STAT 493 and 494) and a winter study (WSP 031) of independent research, culminating in a
thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study involving a one semester (MATH/STAT 493 or 494)
and a winter study (WSP 030) of independent research, culminating in a “minithesis” and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the
major requirements, and thesis courses do not count as 400-level senior seminars.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examinations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement or originality. Such a student usually will
have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a mini-thesis. An outstanding student who writes a mini-thesis, or pursues actuarial
honors and writes a paper, might also be considered. In all cases, the award of honors and highest honors is the decision of the Department.
CAREER PATHS
Graduate School in Mathematics or Statistics: Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathematics 350
(formerly 301) and 355 (formerly 312). Topology, complex analysis, and second courses in real analysis and abstract algebra are strongly recommended. Many
of the 400-level courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Reading knowledge of a foreign
language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
Students interested in continuing their study of statistics in graduate school should take Stat 201, 231, 346, a 400 level statistics course and Math 350 (formerly
301) and 341.
Other Graduate and Professional Schools: An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a prerequisite to
admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to
find out the requirements in those fields early in their college careers.
Statistics and Actuarial Science: Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics courses, and Economics 255.
Additionally, students should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors
program in actuarial studies (see section on honors above).
Teaching: Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider courses on teaching, number theory, geometry, statistics, and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended. Consult the
Program in Teaching (Professor Susan Engel) and the Office of Career Counseling.
Applied Mathematics or Other Sciences: Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences should consider Mathematics 200 (formerly 251),
209/210, 351 (formerly 305), and other applied electives, Statistics courses, and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics, including appropriate courses in Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, and Physics.
Business and Finance: Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 333 (formerly 373) and Statistics courses. Since these
courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be most appropriate for individuals.
Engineering: Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics above, with Mathematics 209 and
351 (formerly 305) especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the
section on engineering near the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.

MATHEMATICS COURSES

MATH 113(F) The Beauty of Numbers (Q)
Have you ever wondered what keeps your credit card information safe everytime you buy something online? Number theory!
Number Theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. In this course, we will discover the beauty and usefulness of numbers, from ancient Greece to modern cryptography. We will look for patterns, make conjectures, and learn how to prove these conjectures. Starting with nothing more than basic high school algebra, we will develop the logic
and critical thinking skills required to realize and prove mathematical results.
Topics to be covered include the meaning and content of proof, prime numbers, divisibility, rationality, modular arithmetic, Fermat’s Last Theorem, the Golden ratio, Fibonacci
numbers, coding theory, and unique factorization.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25).

MATH 115 (formerly 175) Mathematical Politics: Voting, Power, and Conflict (Same as INTR 160) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election? Do any two senators really have equal power in passing legislation? How can marital assets be divided fairly? While these
questions are of interest to many social scientists, a mathematical perspective can offer a quantitative analysis of issues like these and more. In this course, we will discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting systems and show that, in fact, any such system is flawed. We will also examine a quantitative definition of power and

201

the principles behind fair division. Along the way, we will enhance the critical reasoning skills necessary to tackle any type of problem mathematical or otherwise.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 102(or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30).
PACELLI
MATH 120 (formerly 180) The Art of Mathematical Thinking: An Introduction to the Beauty and Power of Mathematical Ideas (Not offered 2013-2014)
(Q)
What is mathematics? How can it enrich and improve your life? What do mathematicians think about and how do they go about tackling challenging questions? Most people
envision mathematicians as people who solve equations or perform arithmetic. In fact, mathematics is an artistic endeavor which requires both imagination and creativity. In this
course, we will experience what this is all about by discovering various beautiful branches of mathematics while learning life lessons that will have a positive impact on our lives.
There are two meta-goals for this course: (1) a better perspective into mathematics, and (2) sharper analytical reasoning to solve problems (both mathematical and nonmathematical).
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Not open to students who have taken
mathematics courses other than MATH 102, 130 (formerly 103), 170, Statistics 101 without permission of the instructor.
BURGER
MATH 130(F,S) (formerly 103) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting process called differentiation. The same process also solves “max-min”
problems: how to maximize profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in MATH 130
(formerly 103) without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test). No enrollment limit (expected: 30).

First Semester: BLACKWOOD
10:00-10:50 MWF
Second Semester: FRIENDLANDER
MATH 140(F,S) (formerly 104) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and acquiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving
derivatives (“differential equations”) for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and inverse functions play an important
role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the equivalent of advanced
placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in MATH 104 without the permission of instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement must enroll in MATH 150
(formerly 105) or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 130 (formerly 103) or equivalent; students who have received the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in MATH 140
(formerly 104) without the permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 30).

Second Semester: SILVA
MATH 150(F,S) (formerly 105) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations. This course is the right starting point for
students who have seen differentiation and integration before. Students with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in MATH 150 (formerly
105).
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 140 (formerly 104) or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced Placement Examination. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45).

Second Semester: MILLER
MATH 151(F) (formerly 106) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple integrals. The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The
difference between this course and MATH 150 (formerly 105) is that MATH 150 (formerly 105) covers infinite series instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of
BC 3 or higher should enroll in MATH 151 (formerly 106), as well as students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and who have already been exposed to
infinite series. For further clarification as to whether or not MATH 150 (formerly 105) or MATH 151 (formerly 106) is appropriate, please consult a member of the math/stat
department.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain physical, chemical, biological and economic processes. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations, and geometric methods give insight to many more. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with
ratios and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. We will explore the methods, abstract structures, and modeling applications of ordinary and partial
differential equations and Fourier analysis.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, hour tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: MATH 150 (formerly 105). Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 30). Students may not normally get credit for both MATH 209 and MATH/PHYS 210.

MATH 250(F,S) (formerly 211) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approximately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one
may ask: When does a solution exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course develops the theoretical structure underlying
answers to these and other questions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and inner products.
Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.

MATH 313 Introduction to Number Theory (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The study of numbers dates back thousands of years, and is fundamental in mathematics. In this course, we will investigate both classical and modern questions about numbers.
In particular, we will explore the integers, and examine issues involving primes, divisibility, and congruences. We will also look at the ideas of number and prime in more general
settings, and consider fascinating questions that are simple to understand, but can be quite difficult to answer.

MATH 316 Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics (Same as Physics 316) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Living in the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. This course examines some of
the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for
error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. We also study the standard AES system as well as an increasingly
popular cryptographic strategy based on elliptic curves. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a quantum computer could crack the RSA scheme in short order, and
how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the inherent unpredictability of quantum events.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Physics 210 or MATH 250 (formerly 211) (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors; students not satisfying the course prerequisites but who have

MATH 321 Knot Theory (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known as a knot. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied knots, asking
such questions as, “Given a nasty tangled knot, how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?” Some of the most interesting advances in knot theory have
occurred in the last ten years.
This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of knot tabulation, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials associated to knots,
and relationships between knot theory and chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open problems in the field. Format: lecture. Evaluation will be
based on problem sets, midterms, and a final exam.

MATH 322T (formerly 309) Introduction to Complex Analysis (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The complex numbers are amazingly useful in mathematics, physics, engineering, and elsewhere. We’ll learn the meaning of complex multiplication and exponentiation, as in
Euler’s famous eπ = -1. We’ll study complex functions and their power series, learn how to integrate in the complex plane, including residue calculus, and how to map one
domain to another (conformal mapping). We’ll see the easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which says that every algebraic equation has a solution as long as
you allow complex numbers.

MATH 325(F) (formerly 365) Set Theory (Q)
Set theory is the traditional foundational language for all of mathematics. We will be discussing the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, including the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum
Hypothesis, basic independence results and, if time permits, the Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem. At one time, these issues tore at the foundations of mathematics. They are still
vital for understanding the nature of mathematical truth.

MATH 326 (formerly 322) Differential Geometry (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
It is easy to convince oneself that the shortest distance from equatorial Africa to equatorial South America is along the equator. This illustrates the fact that “straight lines” on a
sphere are described by so-called great circles. It is somewhat more difficult to describe the shortest path between two points on the surface of, for example, a doughnut, reflecting
the fact that a doughnut curves in space in a more complicated way than the sphere. Differential geometry is the mathematical language describing these curvature properties. In
this course we will learn this language and use it to answer many interesting questions. We will also develop the tools needed to begin the more advanced study of “Riemannian”
geometry, which describes (among other things) Einstein’s Relativity Theory.
Topics: Curves in space, the Frenet-Serret Theorem, the first and second fundamental forms, geodesics, principal/Gaussian/mean/normal curvatures, the Theorema Egregium,
the Gauss-Bonnet formula and Theorem, introduction to n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds/metrics/curvature.

MATH 327 Computational Geometry (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The subject of computational geometry started just 25 years ago, and this course is designed to introduce its fundamental ideas. Our goal is to explore ‘‘visualization’’ and
‘‘shape’’ in real world problems. We focus on both theoretic ideas (such as visibility, polyhedra, Voronoi diagrams, triangulations, motion) as well as applications (such as
cartography, origami, robotics, surface meshing, rigidity). This is a beautiful subject with a tremendous amount of active research and numerous unsolved problems, relating
powerful ideas from mathematics and computer science.

MATH 329(F) Geometry By Its History (Q)
The thorough study of Euclidean geometry has been a cornerstone of a complete education for thousands of years. In this course, we trace the origins of modern geometry by
studying its classical roots, including ancient Greek geometry, conic sections, triangle centers, circle theorems, trigonometry, and analytic geometry. Other topics include the
impossibility of doubling the cube or trisecting an angle, non–constructable polygons, non–Euclidean geometry, and geometry in higher dimensions.

MATH 355(F,S) (formerly 312) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special properties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we generalize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when equations can and cannot be
solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism,
and various types of field extensions.

MATH 369T (formerly 308) Analysis and Number Theory (Same as MATH 406T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Gauss said Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory the queen of mathematics; in this class we shall meet some of her subjects. We will discuss many of the
most important questions in analytic and additive number theory, with an emphasis on techniques and open problems; students are strongly encouraged to perform original
research on these problems, which can range from numerical to theoretical investigations. Topics include Additive Number Theory (especially Goldbachs Problem and the
Circle Method, the 3x+1 Problem, and More Sum Than Difference Sets), the Riemann Zeta Function and Random Matrix Theory, and Benfords law of digit bias; other topics
will be chosen by student interest. We occasionally assume some advanced results for our investigations, though we will always try to supply heuristics and motivate the material.
No number theory background is assumed, and we will discuss whatever material we need from probability, statistics or Fourier analysis.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on scholarship, discussions, homework, examinations, papers and presentations.
Prerequisites: for those taking 369T: at least one of 350/351/355 (formerly 301/305/312; for those taking 406T: one of 350/351 (formerly 301/305) AND 355 (formerly 312).

MATH 372(F) (formerly 302) Complex Analysis (Q)
The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an example of simplicity, every complex-differentiable function is automatically infinitely differentiable. As examples of power, the so-called “residue calculus” permits the computation of “impossible” integrals, and “conformal mapping” reduces physical
problems on very general domains to problems on the round disc. The easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, not to mention the first proof of the Prime Number
Theorem, used complex analysis.

MATH 374T(S) Topology (Q)
Topology is the study of when one geometric object can be continuously deformed and twisted into another object. Determining when two objects are topologically the same is
incredibly difficult and is still the subject of a tremendous amount of research, including recent work on the Poincare Conjecture, one of the million-dollar millennium-prize
problems. The first part of the course on point-set topology, establishes a framework based on “open sets” for studying continuity and compactness in very general spaces. The
second part on homotopy theory, develops refined methods for determining when objects are the same. We will prove for example that you cannot twist a basketball into a
doughnut.

MATH 394T(F) (formerly 314) Galois Theory and Modules (Q)
In the 1830’s Evariste Galois developed a beautiful theory relating the structure of field extensions to the structure of a group. By understanding this relationship, one can often
translate a problem about field extensions to a question about groups that is easier to answer. In this course, we will study Galois Theory and modules. A module is a generalization of vector spaces; in particular, a module can be thought of as a vector space with the weaker condition that the set of scalars are elements of a ring instead of a field. Possible
topics covered will include field theory, galois theory, quotient modules, direct sums, free modules, and exact sequences.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on written homeworks, oral presentations, and exams.

MATH 402 Measure Theory and Probability (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The study of measure theory arose from the study of stochastic (probabilistic) systems. Applications of measure theory lie in biology, chemistry, physics as well as in economics.
In this course, we develop the abstract concepts of measure theory and ground them in probability spaces. Included will be Lebesgue and Borel measures, measurable functions
(random variables). Lebesgue integration, distributions, independence, convergence and limit theorems. This material provides good preparation for graduate studies in mathematics, statistics and economics.

MATH 404(S) Ergodic Theory (Q)
Ergodic theory studies the probabilistic behavior of dynamical systems as they evolve through time. This course will be an introduction to the basic notions in ergodic theory. The
course starts with an introduction to measure theory: (sigma-algebras, measurable sets and measurable transformations and Lebesgue integration). Then we will cover ergodic,
weak mixing, mixing, and Bernoulli transformations, and transformations admitting and not admitting an invariant measure. There will be an emphasis on specific examples
such as group rotations, the binary odometer transformations, and rank-one constructions. We will also cover some notions from topological dynamics.

MATH 411 Commutative Algebra (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Commutative algebra has applications ranging from algebraic geometry to coding theory. For example, one can use commutative algebra to create error correcting codes. It is
perhaps most often used, however, to study curves and surfaces in different spaces. To understand these structures, one must study polynomial rings over fields. This course will
be an introduction to commutative algebra. Possible topics include polynomial rings, localizations, primary decomposition, completions, and modules.

MATH 416 Advanced Applied Linear Algebra (Q) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In the first N math classes of your career, it’s possible to get an incomplete picture as to what the real world is truly like. How? You’re often given exact problems and told to find
exact solutions. The real world is sadly far more complicated. Frequently we cannot exactly solve problems; moreover, the problems we try to solve are themselves merely
approximations to the world. We’re forced to develop techniques to approximate not just solutions, but even the statement of the problem. In this course we discuss some
powerful methods from advanced linear algebra and their applications to the real world, specifically linear programming (and, if time permits, random matrix theory). Linear
programming is used to attack a variety of problems, from applied ones such as the traveling salesman problem, determining schedules for major league sports (or a movie
theater, or an airline) to designing efficient diets to feed the world, to pure ones such as Hales’ proof of the Kepler conjecture.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, possible presentations and write-ups, exams and scholarship.

MATH 419 Algebraic Number Theory (Not offered 2013-2014)(Q)
We all know that integers can be factored into prime numbers and that this factorization is essentially unique. In more general settings, it often still makes sense to factor numbers
into “primes,” but the factorization is not necessarily unique! This surprising fact was the downfall of Lamé’s attempted proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem in 1847. Although a
valid proof was not discovered until over 150 years later, this error gave rise to a new branch of mathematics: algebraic number theory. In this course, we will study factorization
and other number-theoretic notions in more abstract algebraic settings, and we will see a beautiful interplay between groups, rings, and fields.
Format: lecture/seminar. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and exams.

MATH 425(F) Soap Bubbles and Geometric Measure Theory (Q)
A single round soap bubble is the least-area way to enclose a given volume of air, as ws proved in 1884 by Schwarz. A double soap bubble is the least-area way to enclose and
separate two given volumes of air, as was proved in 2000 as the culmination of a decade of work by many, including Williams faculty and students. Because it is hard to control
ahead of time the complicated ways (“singularities”) in which pieces of soap film theoretically might come together, the study of such physical problems had to wait for the
development of a more general and inclusive kind of geometry, now known as Geometric Measure Theory. (These same tools can be applied to all kinds of singularities from
fractures in materials to black holes in the universe.

Since humankind first utilized stones and bricks to tile the floors of their abodes, tiling has been an area of interest. Practitioners include artists, engineers, designers, architects,
crystallographers, scientists and mathematicians. This course will be an investigation into the mathematical theory of tiling. The course will focus on tilings of the plane,
including topics such as the symmetry groups of tilings, the topology of tilings, the ergodic theory of tilings, the classification of tilings and the aperiodic Penrose tilings. We
will also look at tilings in higher dimensions, including “knotted tilings”.

MATH 432(S) Lie Algebras (Q)
A Lie algebra is a vector space endowed with a multiplication operation known as a bracket. They have applications to a wide variety of mathematical fields such as geometry,
representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. This course will cover the basic theory of Lie algebras, including solvable and nilpotent Lie algebras, Cartan
subalgebras, the Killing form, root systems, the Weyl group, Dynkin diagrams, and Cartan matrices. Special attention will be paid to examples that highlight the importance of
Lie algebras in modern mathematics.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework assignments, exams, projects, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 355 (formerly 312) or 317 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected 40). Preference will be given to senior Mathematics majors.

MATH 433 Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical form. In this abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be
carefully examined and real-world behavior can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investigate include feedback phenomena, phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-diffusion equations, shock waves, morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution, forest fires, and diseases. Often the natural phenomenon has some aspect we can control—such as how much pollution, electric charge, or chemotherapeutic agent we put into a river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will investigate
how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize some interpretation of performance. We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations and
dynamical systems. The course is intended for students in the mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences, as well as for students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics, geology, biology, and environmental studies.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance of problem sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Differential Equations (MATH 209/PHYS 210) and Real Analysis (MATH 350/351) (formerly 301/305), or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 50

MATH 437(F) Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians (Q)
Maxwell’s equations are four simple formulas, linking electricity and magnetism, that are among the most profound equations ever discovered. These equations led to the
prediction of radio waves, to the realization that a description of light is also contained in these equations and to the discovery of the special theory of relativity. In fact, almost all
current descriptions of the fundamental laws of the universe are deep generalizations of Maxwell’s equations. Perhaps even more surprising is that these equations and their
generalizations have led to some of the most important mathematical discoveries (where there is no obvious physics) of the last 25 years. For example, much of the math world
was shocked at how these physics generalizations became one of the main tools in geometry from the 1980s until today. It seems that the mathematics behind Maxwell is endless.
This will be an introduction to Maxwell’s equations, from the perspective of a mathematician.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework and exams.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports
broadcasters overwhelm the listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted representations of quantitative information?
How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose of this
course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference including the
t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applications will come from the real world that we all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test). Students who have had calculus, and potential majors in science, economics or mathematics should
consider taking STAT 201 instead. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 40). Not open for major credit to junior or senior Mathematics majors.

STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making, whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived
information it contains. Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, “Data, data, data! I can’t make bricks without clay.” In this
course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the standard tools of statistical inference such
as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 150 (formerly 105) or equivalent. Students without any calculus background should consider STAT 101 instead. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).

STAT 202(S) Introduction to Statistical Modeling (Q)
Data come from a variety of sources - sometimes from planned experiments or designed surveys, but also arise by much less organized means. In this course we’ll explore the
kinds of models and predictions that we can make from both kinds of data as well as design aspects of collecting data. We’ll focus on model building, especially multiple
regression, and talk about its potential as well as its limits to answer questions about the world. We’ll emphasize applications over theory and analyze real data sets throughout the
course. NOTE: Students wanting to take this course on a pass/fail basis will only be allowed to do so with the permission of the instructor.
Format: lecture. Requirements: Evaluation will be based on homework, exams and projects.
Prerequisites: STAT 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected 20). Preference given to sophomores.

STAT 231T Statistical Design of Experiments (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
What does statistics have to do with designing and carrying out experiments? The answer is, surprisingly perhaps, a great deal. In this course, we will study how to design an
experiment with the fewest number of observations possible to achieve a certain power. We will also learn how to analyze and present the resulting data and draw conclusions.
After reviewing basic statistical theory and two sample comparisons, we cover one and two-way ANOVA and (fractional) factorial designs extensively. The culmination of the
course will be a project where each student designs, carries out, analyzes, and presents an experiment of interest to him or her. Throughout the course, we will use the free
statistical software program R to carry out the statistical analysis.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on exams, homework and the final project.
Prerequisites: a previous introductory course in statistics and no fear of simple computer programming and calculus. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 10).

STAT 341 Bayesian Statistics (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The probability of an event can be defined in two ways: (1) the long-run frequency of the event, or (2) the belief that the event will occur. Classical statistical inference is built on
the first definition given above, while Bayesian statistical inference is built on the second. This course will introduce the student to methods in Bayesian statistics. Topics covered
include: prior distributions, posterior distributions, conjugacy, and Bayesian inference in single-parameter, multi-parameter, and hierarchical models. The computational issues
associated with each of these topics will also be discussed.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on homework and exams.
Prerequisites: STATS 201 and MATH 250 (formerly 211), or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected 10). Preference given to juniors and seniors, Math majors.

STAT 346(F) Regression and Forecasting (Q)
This course focuses on the building of empirical models through data in order to predict, explain, and interpret scientific phenomena. The main focus will be on multiple regression as a technique for doing this. We will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a discussion of the limits to such analyses. The
applications will range from a broad range of disciplines, such as predicting the waiting time between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser, forecasting housing prices or modeling
the probability of O-ring failure at Space Shuttle launches.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on exams, homework, and a project.
Prerequisites: STAT 101 or 201, and MATH 150 (formerly 105) and 250 (formerly 211); or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

STAT 355 Multivariate Statistical Analysis (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
In elementary statistics courses, one typically studies how to analyze data and make inferences when only one population variable is of interest. But what if one wanted to make
inferences about more than one variable in the population? In such cases, elementary statistical methods might not apply. In this course, we study the tools and the intuition that
are necessary to analyze and describe such data sets. Specific topics covered will include the multivariate normal distribution, multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, factor analysis, canonical correlation, and clustering.
Format: lecture. Requirements: evaluation will be based on homework and exams.

STAT 440(S) Categorical Data Analysis (Q)
This course focuses on methods for analyzing categorical response data. In contrast to continuous data, categorical data consist of observations classified into two or more
categories. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis are not designed to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. We will develop methods specifically designed to
address the discrete nature of the observations and consider many applications in the social and biological sciences as well as in medicine, engineering and economics. All
methods can be viewed as extensions of traditional regression models and ANOVA.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on exams, homework, and a project.

STAT 442 Computational Statistics and Data Mining (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
In both science and industry today, the ability to collect and store data can outpace our ability to analyze it. Traditional techniques in statistics are often unable to cope with the size
and complexity of today’s data bases and data warehouses. New methodologies in Statistics have recently been developed, designed to address these inadequacies, emphasizing
visualization, exploration and empirical model building at the expense of traditional hypothesis testing. In this course we will examine these new techniques and apply them to a
variety of real data sets using Silicon Graphics workstations.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
100-level courses are introductory in nature. They aim to acquaint students with a variety of topics in music, ranging from the materials of music (introductory music
theory and musicianship) to various musical cultures (African, American, Asian, Caribbean, and European) and styles within those cultures (classical, folk, and
popular). Most 100-level courses are designed for the general student and have no prerequisites; they assume no prior musical training, and are open to all students
interested in increasing their understanding and appreciation of music. The two 100-level courses that can serve to satisfy specific music theory requirements for the
music major (MUS 103 and104a or 104b) require a working knowledge of musical notation; these courses are geared to potential majors and students with strong
instrumental or vocal background, and are particularly suitable for first-year students interested in taking more advanced courses in music.
200-level courses offer students the opportunity to explore a range of more specialized musical topics, from performance, technology, and musicianship-based
classes to courses focused on specific styles, periods, composers, and examinations of meaning in music. Most regular 200-level courses have no prerequisites but do
require the ability to read music, and are usually open to all students who can do so, regardless of class year. 200-level tutorials and writing intensive courses have no
prerequisites and generally do not require the ability to read music, but the workload and more advanced approach to the subject matter makes these courses best
suited to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The two 200-level courses that complete the music theory requirements for the music major (MUS 201 and 202) have
prerequisites; these courses are geared to potential majors, majors, and students with strong instrumental or vocal background.
300-level courses are designed for sophomores, juniors, and seniors with a background in instrumental or vocal performance and fluency in reading musical notation

207

to focus on specialized topics. All require at least one semester of music theory or its equivalent. Some 300-level courses are experiential in nature, including performance-based coursework in conducting, composition, arranging, orchestration, and improvisation. Others are advanced courses in music theory and analysis, musicology, or ethnomusicology, taught in a seminar context that emphasizes original research and analysis.
400-level courses are intended for advanced juniors and seniors, usually music majors, wishing to pursue thesis, independent study, or small seminar coursework in
composition, theory and analysis, musicology, ethnomusicology, or performance, under the guidance of an individual faculty advisor.
MAJOR (Class of 2017 and beyond)
A minimum of ten courses are required for the major, as detailed below.
Four courses in Music Theory and Musicianship to be taken in sequence:
Music 103
Music 104a (Music Theory and Musicianship I) or Music 104b (Jazz Theory and Musicianship I)
Music 201
Music 202
Three courses in European and American Music History: Music 231, 232, 233
Majors may choose to replace a maximum of any one of these three specific courses with a course in music history covering aspects of the same period from those listed
after each specific course number below.
Music 231: 163, 164, 171, or 261
Music 232: 165, 166, 236, or 266T

Two electives: One must be taken in the senior year and at the 400-level to serve as a capstone course. (The second semester of a year-long honors thesis,
MUS 494, will satisfy the 400-level elective requirement.) The other elective may be fulfilled in any semester by any Music course but must be taken in addition to courses selected to satisfy the history, theory, and world music/ethnomusicology requirements detailed above.
Majors are required to participate in faculty-directed departmental ensembles for at least four semesters.
Majors must enroll in partial credit music lessons for at least two semesters.

Elective Courses
An additional two semester courses in music, to be selected from the following:
Group A: any 111-180, 222, 236-280, 311-380, 471-480 courses. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined to
be over-prepared.
Group B: 203-220, 301-310, 381-399, 491-499.
Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from each group. For questions arising from the renumbering of courses, please contact the Department
Chair.
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete 103, 104, 201, 202 and 231 by the end of the sophomore year.

Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at Williams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in
departmental ensembles for at least four semesters. Under special circumstances the student may petition the music faculty to allow this requirement to be met in an alternative
way.

Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.

Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard
proficiency, throughout their entire Williams career.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes provide the opportunity for honors or highest honors consideration in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year supported by a 10- to 15-page discussion of the student’s
work or analysis of a major 20th century or contemporary work. The student’s general portfolio of compositions completed during the junior and senior years
will also be considered in determining honors.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the senior year supported by a 15- to 20-page discussion of one
or more of the works performed. The student’s general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in
length. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research. A public oral thesis defense is also required.
In order for a thesis proposal to be approved a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and must have
demonstrated outstanding ability and experience through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. Students are encouraged to seek the advice of their potential
thesis advisor early in the junior year and no later than the first month of the second semester. A 1- to 2-page proposal written in consultation with the faculty advisor must be
received by the Music chair by the end of spring break.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is highly qualified for honors work, but is unable to pursue a year-long
project for compelling reasons, may petition the department for permission to pursue a WS/one-semester thesis. The standards for evaluating such a thesis remain the same.
Completed thesis is due by April 15.

LESSONS
Courses in individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized by the department. The fees are waived for music majors. (See Music 281-288
and Advanced Musical Performance 391, 392, 491, 492). For further information check the Music Department webpage and contact the Department of Music.

STUDY ABROAD
One study abroad course may satisfy the one free elective requirement for the major, if approved by the department. A second study abroad course might satisfy any one of the
specific required courses if the proposed course is clearly equivalent and if the substitution is approved by the department. Majors planning to study abroad should meet with the
department chair to propose specific study abroad courses that might be approved to satisfy major requirements under this policy. No more than two courses taken abroad may
count toward the major. Music lesson courses and ensemble participation pursued while studying abroad may count toward the performance requirements with approval of the
department.

100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction to the Western Classical Tradition
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music—on the radio, on your Ipod, at a concert—how much do you really hear? This course aims to refine students’ listening skills so as to enhance their
understanding and enjoyment of music. It also provides an introduction to the major composers, musical styles, and genres of the Western classical tradition. We will study music

208

from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Stravinsky, and other composers. Genres to be covered
include the symphony, string quartet, sonata, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus is required.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on a listening journal, two concert reviews, two quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). If overenrolled, preference will be given to first-years and sophomores and any student who expresses a strong interest in
the course.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF
HIRSCH

MUS 102(F) Introduction to Music Theory
The course presents an introduction to the materials and structures of music. Through a variety of practical exercises and written projects, students will develop an understanding
of the elements of music (e.g. pitch, scales, triads, rhythm, meter, and their notation) and explore their combination and interaction in the larger-scale organization of works of
classical, jazz and popular music (i.e. harmony, counterpoint, form, rhetoric). Practical musicianship skills will be developed through in-class and prepared singing, keyboard,
and rhythmic exercises.
Format: lecture two days a week. Evaluation will be based on written and practical quizzes, projects, and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected 16). Preference given to first year students.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR

GOLLIN

MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
MUS 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal backgrounds. Students entering MUS 103 should have a solid understanding of musical rudiments (intervals, scales, keys) and reading proficiency in both bass and treble clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of
MUS 103 to determine if a student requires any additional work to complement and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester, or whether placement in MUS
102 would be more appropriate. Students with a strong background in music theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out of one or both
semesters. MUS 103 and 104 are required for the music major.
MUS 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the harmonic and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca.
1650-1825). The course explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style of J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony
and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an aural understanding of
music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the arrangement of classical period minuets and the composition of vocal canons.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work,
written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear and final projects
Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference given to first years, potential Music majors, and those with strong musicianship backgrounds.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

MUS 104b(S) (formerly 203 and 212) Jazz Theory and Improvisation I (Same as AFR 212)
The theory and application of basic techniques in jazz improvisation and performance styles, including blues forms, swing, bebop, modally based composition, Afro-Cuban, etc.
Appropriate for students with skill on their instrument and some basic theoretical knowledge. Knowledge of all key signatures, major/minor keys and modes, intervals, triads and
basic seventh chords and their functions within keys. Students should be able to play and demonstrate these concepts on their instruments-competence on an instrument is
essential (vocalists and drummers will be encouraged to study the piano). Pianists and guitarists should be able to sight read chords on a jazz lead sheet.
Format: alternates between lecture style exposition of theoretical topics and a master class where students will perform and be evaluated on assigned repertoire. Evaluation will
be based on weekly assignments (e.g., harmonic analysis and exercises in transposition and transcription), a midterm, a transcription project (e.g., of a recorded solo or a composition), and the end of semester concert, as well as improvement as measured in weekly class performance.
This course will meet at the same time as and share aural skills labs with MUS 104a. Students considering taking this course should consult the lab times shown below and plan
their schedules accordingly.
Prerequisites: MUS 103 and/or permission of instructor; musical literacy required as per above description; private study on student’s individual instrument strongly encouraged.

MUS 111(F) (formerly 125) Music Cultures of the World (D)
This course introduces a variety of musical traditions from around the world, from karaoke to reggae and Indian classical traditions. Students develop a working knowledge of
musical terms, influential musicians, and concepts relevant to performance genres hailing from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Beyond engaging with
music’s sound and structure, we will address its capacity to express personal and group identity, and its ability to both reflect and shape broader social ideas and circumstances.
Reading and writing assignments are combined with direct engagement with music and musicians. No prior musical training required.
Format: lecture. Evaluation: based on class attendance and participation, regular short writing assignments, three quizzes, and a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference will be given to current or prospective majors in Music, Anthropology and Sociology, as well as current and
prospective students concentrating in Arabic Studies, Asian Studies, Africana Studies and Latina/o Studies.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF

MUS 112 (formerly 126) Musics of Asia (Same as ASST 126) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course offers an introduction to the great diversity of Asian music. Our survey will span from East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) to Southeast Asia (Thailand and Indonesia) to the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia (Tibet and Afghanistan), to the Middle East (Iran and the Arabian peninsula), and will end with the extension of Asian music across
North Africa and into Eastern Europe. Within this broad survey, we will focus on selected and representative musical cultures and genres. In each section of the course, aspects of
cultural context (including music’s function in religious life and its relationship to the other arts), will be emphasized. While our focus will be on the traditional and classical
musics of these cultures, we will also briefly consider the current musical scene. Encounters with this music will include attendance at live performances when possible.
This course satisfies the EDI requirement by exploring how the diverse musical traditions of Asia are shaped by radically different religious beliefs and social norms and by
demonstrating how various Asian cultures can be understood through their musical traditions. Much of the music we will encounter presents aesthetics and cultural norms that
differ radically from mainstream Euro-American cultural practices. To engage with these traditions students must attempt to place themselves within different cultural frameworks, to hear music that they may find shockingly foreign with a different set of ears.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on four tests and two papers.
No prerequisites; no musical experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20).

MUS 113 Musics of Africa (Same as AFR 113) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course introduces a selection of musical cultures from the geographical breadth of Africa. Following an introductory exploration of the fundamental aesthetic and social
parameters governing African musical practice, we will proceed to examine in more depth regional case studies from North, South, East, West and Central Africa. Attention will
be given to both traditional and urban music-making contexts, and styles covered will include Shona mbira music, Tuareg rock, West African highlife, Ba’Aka vocal polyphony
and South African kwela. Through readings, writing, lecture-demonstrations, and hands-on participation, this course satisfies the EDI requirement by investigating the intersection of African music with politics, gender, advocacy, globalization and other broad themes. This course will meet twice a week.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on four tests, two papers, attendance, and class participation.
No prerequisites: prior musical background is not essential for this class. Enrollment 30 (expected: 25).

MUS 115 (formerly 114) American Music (Not offered 2013-2014)
This lecture and discussion course focuses on American music in its cultural context. Students will explore a range of issues concerning music’s relation to national and ethnic
identity, historical events, societal conflicts, and philosophical, literary, and artistic movements. The class will study works from a variety of musical traditions: e.g., Native
American, religious, classical, patriotic, blues, jazz, folk, Broadway, rock, and rap.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference to students with demonstrated interest in American Studies or Music.
M. HIRSCH

MUS 117 (formerly 122) African-American Music (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course will survey the history of African-American music in the United States from its beginnings through the mid-twentieth century. Themes include: the continuation of
Africanisms in African-American music, transculturation between Black and White American music, and the ever-changing sound of African-American music in the U.S.
There will be an emphasis on discussing music, listening to it, and attending concerts of live music for which there may be additional costs.
This EDI course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the New World (and the Old), as well as the myriad ways in
which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. and/or European hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Evaluation based on hour exam, final exam, and two concert reviews.
No prerequisites, but students without musical backgrounds must learn a vocabulary of terms for describing musical sound; open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 20. If
more than 20 students enroll, priority will be given to Africana Studies majors, music majors, and seniors.
MUS 119 (formerly 111) Popular Music: Revolutions in the History of Rock (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will trace the history of rock music from the 1950s to the present, focusing on those musicians who revolutionized the genre in various periods. Such “revolutions”
are discovered in the use of new sounds and musical forms, in the relationship between lyrics and musical setting, and in the conception of rock’s role in society. Three objectives
will underpin our studies: to develop listening skills with music that one often hears, but perhaps rarely listens to intently; to determine in what ways popular music can be
interpreted as reflecting its cultural context; and to encounter the work of several of the more innovative musicians in the history of rock. Finally we will interrogate our own
activities by asking why the study of the “merely popular” should be pursued in a liberal arts education, whether new approaches can be developed for this endeavor, and what
makes music “popular.”
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites or musical background assumed. Enrollment limit: 80 (expected: 80). Preference given to juniors and sophomores.
W. A. SHEPPARD

MUS 126 (formerly 127) Cuban Popular Music and Culture (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This class will cover genres of Cuban folk, and popular music and the impact that Cuban history has had on Cuban music, art, and culture in general. Topics to be discussed will
include the African influence on Cuban music between the 15th and 16th centuries, the contemporary coexistence of old African musical practices with new musical manifestations now purely Cuban, and the Spanish influence on the Punto Cubano or Punto Guajiro that flourished at the end of the 18th century as a family-neighborhood activity. We will
also discuss the connection between folk music and the utilization of European techniques that gave as a result the danzon, the mambo, the cha cha cha, the Cuban son, as well as
multiple genres of the Cuban cancion (song). Other topics of discussion will include the strong bonds between Cuban music and North American music during the 20th century,
and how the combination of folk music/professional music imparts a dynamic to Afro-Cuban jazz, and salsa. We will also discuss more recent developments of Afro-Cuban
music such as timba cubana, Cuban hip hop, and the social issues represented in their lyrics. A good understanding of Cuban music requires the understanding of Cuban people
and their culture. We will discuss how Cuban music is and has been for centuries an expression and part of the religious and political systems of belief of the Cuban people. Class
examples will also demonstrate how Cuban music is a force that unifies all Cubans regardless of their social class or political view.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two research papers (10 pages long each) and two class presentations on the subject of the research paper.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).

MUS 138 (formerly 115) Riots, Recycling, Rows, and Repetition: Introduction to Twentieth-Century Music (Not offered 2013-2014)
Twentieth-century Euro-American art music involved a persistent exploration of the limits of musical possibility. Encounters with this music often challenge our ears and musical
minds and require us to reconsider fundamental conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will investigate in what ways the basic elements of music (e.g., harmonic
organization, rhythm, timbre, instrumentation and performance conventions) were extended and revolutionized. Topics and styles to be discussed include: atonality, expressionism, twelve-tone techniques, neoclassicism, electronic and computer music, stochastic music, minimalism, and neoromanticism. We will also consider the music of this century
in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts and to popular musical styles. The syllabus will include works by such composers as Debussy, Mahler, Stravinsky,
Schoenberg, Webern, Bartók, Weill, Milhaud, Shostakovich, Ives, Copland, Babbitt, Stockhausen, Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Cage, Górecki, Glass, Gubaidulina, and Tower.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of quizzes, short papers, and performance reports, quizzes will include listening and identifying examples.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference given to juniors, seniors, music majors and potential majors.
KECHLEY

MUS 141 (formerly 106) Opera (Not offered 2013-2014)
An introduction to the history of opera, from the genre’s birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points in its 400-year development, opera has been considered the highest
synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for the social elite, or a form of popular entertainment. Opera’s position in European cultural history will be a primary focus of our inquiry. We will
also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of performance and production, and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations, and political and
sociological approaches. Works to be considered include operas by Monteverdi, Lully, Charpentier, Handel, Gluck, Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Bizet, Puccini,
Strauss, Berg, Britten, Glass, and Adams. This course may involve a trip to the Metropolitan Opera.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a brief paper, an 8-page paper, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20).

MUS 145 (formerly 109) Symphony (Not offered 2013-2014)
A musical and cultural historical survey of music for the symphony orchestra as observed in the late-eighteenth through the twentieth century. Genres to be explored include the
symphony, concerto, tone poem, and concert overture, by composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Liszt, Brahms, Mahler, Richard Strauss, Ravel, Bartok,
Crumb, Hailstork, and Joan Tower. Emphasis on listening.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on two hour-exams or quizzes from listening assignments and readings, one short paper and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
MUS 146 (formerly 108) The Concerto (Not offered 2013-2014)
More than any other instrumental genre in music, the concerto by its nature tells stories. As in opera, the concerto focuses on a protagonist, usually a single soloist; the interest of
the work lies in the dynamic musical interplay between that individual and the larger ensemble. This course will explore the development of the concerto, from its origins in
17th-century Italy through the 20th century. We will focus on the musical means by which composers of the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, working in a
wide variety of styles, created compelling musical narratives. We will also consider the cultural contexts within which concerti are composed and performed, giving particular
attention to the persona of the virtuoso as exemplified by such figures as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Clara Schumann, Liszt, Paganini, Horowitz, and Marta Argerich. Works to be
studied will include several concerti to be performed on campus by the Berkshire Symphony with professional and student soloists.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short quizzes and papers, a midterm and a final exam, and attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
BLOXAM

MUS 147 (formerly 110) Chamber Music (Not offered 2013-2014)
A musical and cultural historical survey of music for small instrumental ensembles from the early-eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. Defined for this course as ensemble
music for from three to eight players, we will consider string quartets, works for strings and piano, and examples of wind and brass chamber music by Bach, Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, Brahms, Webern, Bartok, Beach, Hailstork and many others. Several live performances will be presented in class by faculty and visiting chamber musicians.
Format: lecture, twice per week. Evaluation will be based on several listening quizzes or short exams, a paper based on research or listening, and a final exam
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
MUS 149 The Language of Film Music (Not offered 2013-2014)
Film composers, once viewed as less serious than their concert music counterparts, have become celebrities today. John Williams, James Horner, Howard Shore, and Carter
Burwell are as well known as Stravinsky, Holst, Shostakovich, and Strauss. The only symphony orchestra many people hear today is the one at the movies and when people do
attend concerts, the music often reminds them of film scores. The way we perceive cinematic narrative is highly dependent upon the way the composer scores it. We may not
always be conscious of the composer’s craft, but we almost always know how we are supposed to feel or think about what is going on in a film because of the powerful musical

210

cues. How did this language of film music evolve and where did many of the iconic musical gestures come from? These questions will be explored along with specific techniques
film composers have used over the years to manipulate our perception of the visual narrative. We will look at and listen to films from different periods, observe which techniques
evolved, which have changed very little, and consider when an idea is borrowed and when it might actually be new. Assignments will consist of listening/viewing as well as
re-interpreting film clips with music you will compose or borrow. Lecture/Discussion. Midterm and final also will also involve viewing/listening.
Format: lecture. Requirements: assignments, midterm, final.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to juniors and seniors, Music majors and potential majors.
May not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

MUS 151 (formerly 130) History of Jazz (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course surveys the history of jazz from its origins to the present. Emphasis is on the contributions of the major figures in jazz as seen against the backdrop of their social
milieu. Emphasis on the relationship between music and the social experience of African Americans.
This EDI course explores the experiences and expressions of the culturally diverse peoples of African descent in the New World (and the Old), as well as the myriad ways in
which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. and/or European hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: lecture with some discussion. Evaluations based on the following: homework 50%, one concert review 20%, research paper 30%.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to jazz musicians, Africana Studies concentrators, and seniors.

MUS 152(F) A Composer’s History of Jazz (Same as AFR 152) (W) (D)
This course will provide a chronological survey of jazz composers, beginning with the pre-jazz era and continuing through the present day. Students will be required to do
assigned listening and read related criticism and biographical material. In addition, students will write several responsive papers summarizing these listening and reading experiences. Each student will also write a biographical paper about a composer (or composer/arranger) of her choice, and participate in a collaborative presentation at the end of the
semester on a composition or set of compositions from a list of possibilities provided by the instructor. Midterm and final examinations will focus on analytical aural skills
developed during the semester, both in terms of formal analysis and composer identification. Composers whose work will be covered will include: Scott Joplin, James P. Johnson, Jelly Roll Morton, George Gershwin, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Mary Lou Williams, Benny Carter, Ernie Wilkins, Quincy Jones, Gil Evans, Frank Foster, John
Lewis, Dave Brubeck, Oliver Nelson, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Hermeto Pascoal, Eddie Palmieri, Thad Jones, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Jaco Pastorius,
Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Yusef Lateef, Bill Evans, Maria Schneider, Billy Childs, and others. This course will be writing intensive, with the understanding being that students
will have advance deadlines and the opportunity to revise written work prior to final submission.
As an EDI offering, the course materials will be designed not only to expose the student to the music, but also to provide an examination of the relationship between jazz
composers and the historical and cultural worlds in which they created their Art. Readings will include the perspective of musicians, audiences and critics, as well as an examination of who they were and what agendas and prevailing societal attitudes may have shaped their reactions to the music. Comparisons between the experiences of composers and
their listeners in different eras will provide additional perspective.
Format: lecture. Evaluation based on short response papers based on reading and listening; midterm and final exams; and a research paper on the career of a composer of the
student’s choice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference will be given to music majors and then jazz ensemble members.

MUS 163 (formerly 118) Bach (Not offered 2013-2014)
Johann Sebastian Bach now enjoys the status of a cultural icon, transcending time and place. But who was Bach, and why do his musical creations continue to fascinate us? This
course offers an introduction to the life and music of this iconic composer. We will explore aspects of cultural context (such as the social milieu in which Bach developed his art
and the use and perception of his music by his contemporaries), as well develop our listening skills by exploring matters of purely musical content (the styles and forms of his
prodigious oeuvre). Both instrumental and vocal music will be surveyed, including the Brandenburg Concerti, the Goldberg Variations, the Magnificat, and the B Minor Mass.
The course will conclude with a consideration of Bach’s legacy in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on 2 papers, a midterm, a final exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 15).
Not available for the Gaudino option.
BLOXAM

MUS 164 (formerly 136) Bach and Handel: Their Music in High Baroque Culture (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course explores the lives and music of two great composers of the High Baroque, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. We will examine their dramatically
contrasting life experiences and musical pursuits within the larger social and cultural framework of the period: Bach as a provincial composer, servant to minor German aristocrats and the Lutheran Church, virtuoso organist and pedagogue; Handel as a cosmopolitan celebrity and entrepreneur, creator of operatic and instrumental entertainments for
both the Italian and English nobility and the paying public. Development of listening skills and understanding of Baroque music styles, genres, and forms will be stressed. Bach’s
Brandenburg Concerti and Mass in B-minor, and Handel’s opera Giulio Cesare and Water Music Suite are just a few of the works to be discussed and enjoyed.
Format: lecture/discussion, two meetings per week; field trip may be required. Evaluation will be based on participation, two papers, a midterm, and a final exam.

This course will examine the extraordinary life and musical genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Through lectures, discussion, readings, and guided listening, students will gain
appreciation of Mozart’s classical compositional style and familiarity with many of his greatest works. The class will explore Mozart’s pivotal position as a musician in Viennese
society; his strange combination of bawdy behavior and sublime artistry; his relationship with his domineering father Leopold, as well as with Haydn, Beethoven, and Salieri;
and the myths about Mozart that have sprung up in the two centuries since his death.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, listening quizzes, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to students with demonstrated interest in music.
M. HIRSCH

MUS 166(F) (formerly 120) Beethoven
This course provides an introduction to the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer’s difficult childhood, tragic loss of hearing, clandestine affair with his
“Immortal Beloved,” and tempestuous relationship with his suicidal nephew Karl, together with the French Revolution and emergence of Romanticism, will form the backdrop
for our investigation of his artistic struggles and monumental achievements. Students will listen to a broad cross section of Beethoven’s music, including piano sonatas, string
quartets, symphonies, overtures, concertos, choral works, and opera. We will explore a range of topics, including the nature of his genius, his relation to composers such as Haydn
and Mozart, and his impact on posterity.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on listening quizzes, two papers, midterm and final exams, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference will be given to those with a demonstrated interest in music.

MUS 171(F) Singing Songs in Early Europe: Music, Poetry, and Pop Culture c. 1000-1500 (W)
Modern singer/songwriters Tom Waits and Bob Dylan may seem far removed from the troubadours of the Middle Ages; similarly, the preponderance of “greatest hits” records
appear to have little in common with the great song collections from the Renaissance. Although many centuries separate the songs that infiltrate our lives today from the songs of
antiquity through to the sixteenth century, the very concept of “song” as we understand it now began to be formed, reformed, and developed in early Europe. Beginning with
Biblical conceptions of song, this course examines song in its diverse contexts through a variety of lenses—text, music, history, and theory. Looking closely at a selection of song
traditions from Western Europe, including dance songs, this course offers students an interdisciplinary perspective on song that draws together through discussion and close
musical and poetic analysis the interrelated areas of music, poetry, analysis, religion, and history. From song as a form of personal expression, communication, and religious
worship, to song as functional, practical, and as a musico-poetic genre, this course introduces students to the concept of locating one type of artistic creation within history,
culture, and society.
Format: seminar. Requirements: four 1-page response papers, a 6-page paper, and a 10-page paper, drafts of both papers will be required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 7).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF

CALDWELL

MUS 172 (formerly 134) Myth in Music (Same as COMP 172) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Orpheus, Prometheus, Faust, and Don Juan—these figures have captured the imagination of writers, artists, and composers throughout history. This course explores how prominent myths of western civilization have found expression in a broad variety of musical works, e.g., operas by Claudio Monteverdi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Jacques Offenbach, and Richard Wagner; songs by Franz Schubert, Hugo Wolf, Ricky Ian Gordon, and Adam Guettel; ballets by Ludwig van Beethoven and Igor Stravinsky; symphonic

211

poems by Franz Liszt, Richard Strauss and Alexander Scriabin; Broadway musicals by Richard Adler, and Randy Newman; and mixed-media projects by Rinde Eckert. Our
inquiry will lead us to ponder an array of questions: Why have certain myths proven especially appealing to composers? What accounts for these myths’ musical longevity? How
have myths been adapted to different musical genres and styles, and for what purposes? How do the works reflect the historical cultures in which they originated? How have they
engaged with different social, political, artistic, and intellectual concerns?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three 6- to 8-page papers (with revisions), and a final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to students with a demonstrated interest in literature or music.
M. HIRSCH
MUS 173 (formerly 135) Storytelling in Music (Not offered 2013-2014)
Many of the songs we hear on the radio derive their appeal, in part, from the interest of the narratives conveyed by their lyrics. Even without lyrics, however, music itself can
compellingly depict characters, emotions, settings, or events in order to relate tales of love, tragic loss, conflict, heroism and victory, transcendence, comedy, adventure, and the
exotic. This course explores the various musical means through which composers of the past several centuries have sought to convey such stories in both texted and untexted
genres including the sixteenth-century madrigal; opera; the concerto and the symphony; nineteenth-century song cycles, solo piano works, and tone-poems; ballet and film
scores; and jazz and rock ’n roll.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on brief written assignments and a paper, a midterm and a final exam, and attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
BLOXAM and HIRSCH
MUS 174(S) (formerly 124) The Singing Voice: Mechanics, History and Meaning
Why does an opera singer sound different from a rock singer? Why can’t one convincingly sing in the style of the other? And why is the former granted a higher status and the
latter a wider audience? This course examines the physiological and acoustical properties of singing and explores the varieties of singing style and function including Western
classical, jazz, pop and gospel as well as less familiar approaches such as overtone singing, yodeling and belting. The historical development of singing styles will be considered
as will the meaning making of specific vocal qualities. Students will learn the basics of several singing styles.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference by seniority.

MUS 238 (formerly 116) Music in Modernism (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The synthesis of the arts was a primary pursuit of modernist composers, artists, choreographers, and writers. Seeking either to realize Wagner’s “total work of art” in the theater,
or to uncover the more general correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their own media. Collaborations on works of “total theater”
were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Picasso; Brecht, Hindemith, Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubinstein. Modernists explored new connections
between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance (Duncan, Graham). Occasionally, modernists attempted to unite the
arts on their own: Schoenberg painted, Pound composed, and Kokoschka wrote. Our focus will be on those works of music, art, dance, and literature that explored new relationships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents exist between techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition.
Aware of the risks and rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our own theories of artistic synthesis. This course is designed to bring multiple perspectives to the study
of music in modernism.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on three papers (6, 8, and 12 pages in length) and on class participation; drafts of two of these papers will be required.
Students will receive detailed comments on each paper, allowing them to build upon those comments in subsequent writing assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10).

MUS 251 (formerly 240) Introduction to the Music of Duke Ellington (Same as AFR 240) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course will survey the career and compositional style of Edward Kennedy (Duke) Ellington (1899-1974). Students will learn to listen to and analyze music from throughout
Ellington’s five-decade career as a bandleader, composer, arranger, and writer. Particular emphasis will be placed on development of aural analysis skills, in terms of form, style,
orchestration, and the ability to identify the individual sounds of key Ellingtonian soloists. Ellington’s importance as a key figure in American cultural history, and the relationships between his music and parallel stylistic developments and influences from both within and outside of the jazz tradition will also be discussed.
Requirements: weekly listening and reading assignments, one biographical paper examining the career of an Ellingtonian, as well as participation in a group presentation to the
class of one of Ellington’s extended works; midterm and final exams will also be given.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference given to Music majors and Africana Studies concentrators.

MUS 252 (formerly 241) Introduction to the Music of John Coltrane (Same as AFR 242) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course offers the serious music student an opportunity to study the unique body of work produced by saxophonist and composer John Coltrane (1926-1967). The course
traces the evolution of Coltrane’s compositional and performance styles in the context of the musical and cultural environment in which they developed. Emphasis placed on
Coltrane’s musical style, representing a unique synthesis of influences, including jazz, world, and European Classical music and spirituality. Substantial reading assignments,
including a biography and related criticism, as well as detailed score analysis and study, are required.
Format: lecture. Evaluation based on in-class participation and preparation, quizzes on assigned readings, midterm and final examinations, and a final paper; evaluation partially
based on participation in an in-class group analysis presentation, and a final paper involving musical analysis of a Coltrane composition or recorded performance.
Prerequisite(s): MUS 103 and/or 203 strongly recommended. Musical literacy sufficient to deal with the material and /or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19

MUS 254(S) Charlie Parker and the (R)evolution of Modern Jazz
In the 1940s, Jazz turned a corner, transitioning from the functional and popular music of the swing era to the increasingly complex art music known as bebop. The practitioners
of this new sub-genre were seen not as showmen or entertainers, but (in the words of poet Ralph Ellison) as “frozen faced introverts, dedicated to chaos.” This class will survey
the life and music of that decade’s most pivotal figure, the brilliant alto saxophonist Charlie “Yardbird” Parker (1920-1955). The ubiquitous graffiti slogan “Bird Lives” that
heralded his untimely death still rings true today, as his influence remains undimmed. In recent decades his music has become a cornerstone of jazz pedagogy, and increasingly is
considered to represent more of an evolution than a revolution in jazz history. We will focus on Parker’s musical development, with a particular emphasis on his study and
musical apprenticeships with some of the major soloists of the swing era. Through score study, guided listening and composition assignments, the class will examine and
practice applications of Parker’s melodic, harmonic and rhythmic innovations. We will evaluate, compare and contrast examples of contemporary theoretical scholarship concerning his improvisational vocabulary. Parker’s broader cultural significance and the intersections between his music and parallel artistic, social and political movements will
also be addressed. While our focus will be on Charlie Parker, the class will also discuss the contributions made to modern jazz by his most prominent collaborators, including
Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell. Additionally, we will consider his influence on subsequent generations of musicians by investigating personal anecdotes as
well as the work of several “first generation disciples,” such as Cannonball Adderley, Jackie McLean and Ornette Coleman. The class will culminate in a final multimedia

213

project in which the students will explore Parker’s musical influence on contemporary jazz musicians.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly reading and listening assignments, class participation, weekly two-page responsive writing in class journal. One musical
transcription, two brief composition assignments. Midterm and Final Exam, (both largely listening based). Final multimedia interview project and presentation.

MUS 261 The Saint and the Countess: The Lost Voices of Medieval Women (Same as WGSS 261) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Very few female voices from the Middle Ages are audible today; most of the music, poetry, and other writings that survives reveals the creativity and expresses the attitudes of
men. This course will explore the experiences and viewpoints of medieval women through the lens of the poetry and songs of two exceptional 12th-century figures: the German
abbess Hildegard of Bingen, whose long and immensely productive life was shaped by the requirements of monastic culture; and the French Countess of Dia in Provence, whose
elusive life and works exemplify the dynamics of aristocratic court culture. We will ask how these and other musical women active in both the sacred and the secular spheres
(such as the nun Birgitta of Sweden, and Queen Blanche of Castile) negotiated their places and made their voices heard within the patriarchal society of their time. We will
examine the ways in which these contrasting environments informed the different outlooks, ideas, and aesthetics expressed in the words and music of their songs. Along the way
we will critically assess how these lost voices have been recreated to speak to us today through recordings and film.
Format:seminar. Evaluation based on several short papers and presentations, and a final project and presentation.
Prerequisite ability to read music useful but not required. Enrollment limit: 10(expected: 8) Preference given to current or prospective majors in Music, WGSS, History, Comparative Literature and Religion.

MUS 266T(S) (formerly 206T) Verdi and Wagner (W)
Born in the same year (1813), Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner stand as the two central figures of nineteenth-century European opera. Their divergent approaches to the
genre provoked heated debate that continues today. Both composers not only transformed the operatic forms they inherited, but they also had a significant impact on the cultural
and political histories of their emerging nations. Throughout the semester we will juxtapose major works by these composers in order to investigate such topics as opera’s
relationship to its literary sources; the staging of opera; intersections between opera and film; connections between opera and political context; and biographical influences on the
creation of opera. Our final meeting will be devoted to the broader operatic and cultural legacies of these two composers. Focusing on one opera per week, we will study Verdi’s
Nabucco, Il trovatore, La traviata, Aida, Otello, and Falstaff, and on Wagner’s Tannhaüser, Lohengrin, Die Walküre, Tristan und Isolde, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, and
Parsifal. When possible, this tutorial will include field trips to live performances and/or live HD broadcasts of these operas.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page essays and on the quality of the student’s critical engagement with the work of his/her tutorial
partner.
Prerequisites: previous related course work and/or musical experience is desirable, but is not required; open to all students. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given

MUS 272T (formerly 244T) Music and Meaning (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Nearly everyone finds music meaningful, but what exactly does it mean? Without the help of words, this largely non-referential art presents special challenges to interpretation.
While most would agree that musical sounds can do such things as mimic the rumbling of thunder, evoke the countryside, suggest the act of chasing, or express rage, the capacity
of music to convey meaning remains controversial among scholars, performers, and listeners. Some, following music critic Eduard Hanslick, assert that musical works are
essentially “tonally moving forms”—patterns of sound with no reference to the world outside themselves; a work’s meaning derives solely from the interplay of musical elements. Others counter that music can signify aspects of human experience, its sounds and structures not merely referring to the outside world but even relating complex narratives. Certain writers have argued that, without the assistance of language, what music signifies remains vague, while others insist that the meaning of music is actually more
precise than that of words. In this tutorial course, we will explore a range of questions regarding musical meaning. How can combinations of pitches, rhythms, and instrumental
timbres signify something beyond themselves? Is the subject of musical meaning more relevant to some historical styles or genres than others? How can we glean the meaning(s)
of a work? Should we concentrate on formal processes within the music? Consider socially constructed meanings? Seek the composer’s intentions? What makes some interpretations more convincing than others? In grappling with these questions, students will engage with writings by Agawu, Cone, Hanslick, Kramer, Langer, Lewin, Newcomb,
and Schopenhauer, among others. Music to be studied includes works by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Ravel, Stravinsky, Glass, and Adams.
Format: tutorial. During the first and last weeks of the semester, students will attend two group classes. In the other weeks, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for a
one-hour session. Students will write and present a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and a 1-2 page response to their partner’s paper in the alternate weeks. Evaluation will be
based on five papers/presentations, and five responses.
Prerequisites: ability to read music, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

MUS 273T Dangerous Music (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
As a largely non-referential art whose meanings are far from transparent, music might seem to pose little danger. How could mere sounds represent a threat? Yet precisely
because its meanings can be obscure, enabling it to achieve its ends surreptitiously, music has intertwined with danger throughout history. With its power to stir the emotions,
stimulate bodily movement, encode messages, and foment rebellion, music has often been perceived as an agent of harm. Plato claimed that too much music could make a man
effeminate or neurotic, and warned that certain musical modes, melodies, and rhythms promote licentious behavior and anarchic societies. Puritans, Victorians, and Totalitarians,
as well as opponents of ragtime, rock ’n roll, and rap, have also accused certain musical genres or styles of exerting dangerous influences, and sought to limit or suppress them. In
Afghanistan, the Taliban banned music altogether. While music has often been unfairly accused, its potential for placing people in actual danger is undeniable. Works that are
played at ear-splitting decibel levels, that call upon performers to injure themselves, that are used as a form of psychological torture, or that incite violence demand reconsideration of the widely shared view that music is fundamentally a form of entertainment. This tutorial course will explore the intersection of music and danger in a broad range of
historical, cultural, and global contexts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on participation, five 5- to 6-page papers/presentations, and five 1- to 2-page responses.
Prerequisites: an ability to read music is desirable but not required. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

MUS 277 (formerly 133) Men, Women, and Pianos (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course takes the piano, its repertory, and its performers as focal points for a social history of Western music, treating the piano as a locus around which issues of gender, class
and race are played out in musical life from the Classical period to our own time. In addition to exploring works by canonical composers such as Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms,
we will consider parlor music, virtuoso showpieces, and experimental work by such figures as Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Frank Liszt, and Henry Cowell. The style and technique
of a broad range of classical and popular performers will be examined, ranging from Clara Schumann, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Glenn Gould to the phenomena
of Liberace and Yanni. Finally, we will analyze several films in which the piano plays a central role, including Robert Rafelson’s Five Easy Pieces from 1970, and Jane Campion’s The Piano from 1993.
Format: lecture/discussion. Two meetings per week. Evaluation based on participation, several short papers and quizzes, and a final project.
Prerequisites: ability to read music. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to students who are taking or have taken piano lessons.

MUS 278T (formerly 246T) Carmen, 1845-Now (Same as WGSS 248T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W) (D)
The story of the gypsy femme fatale Carmen has endured for over 150 years. In Western culture she exemplifies the seductive, exotic, independent and forbidden woman who
drives an upstanding man to a life of crime and finally murder. This course explores a broad array of treatments of this archetypal narrative, starting with Prosper Mérimée’s 1845
novella on which Bizet based his beloved 1875 opera Carmen. We will consider various staged and film versions of the opera itself, including Francesco Rosi’s stunning 1984
movie, and discuss various other film transformations of the story, from DeMille’s 1915 silent film through Hammerstein’s 1954 all-black musical Carmen Jones, to the MTV
version A Hip Hopera of 2004. Comic approaches will also be assessed, from Charlie Chaplin’s Carmen Burlesque of 1915 through Spike Jones’ 1952 Carmen Murdered! and
The Naked Carmen of 1970. We will explore remarkable dance interpretations ranging from Carlos Saura’s 1983 flamenco version through David Bourne’s choreography in his
2001 gay reading called The Car Man. This course satisfies the EDI requirement through a critical examination of the way in which the Carmen story has served as a stage on
which multifaceted textual and musical constructions and conflicts of individual and group identities, encompassing gender and sexuality, nationality, ethnicity, and class are
played out.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After initial group meetings to discuss Mérimée’s novella and Bizet’s music, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each
week. Each student will write a 5- to 6-page essay every other week (five in all), and provide peer reviews in alternate weeks. Evaluation will be based on the quality of written

MUS 279T (formerly 210T) American Pop Orientalism (Not offered 2013-2014) (W) (D)
This tutorial will investigate the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in American popular culture since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on music’s role in
Orientalist representation in a wide variety of media, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, Broadway musicals, and novels. We will begin with major texts in
cultural theory (Said, Bhabha) and will attempt throughout the semester to revise and refine their tenets. Can American Orientalism be distinguished in any fundamental way
from nineteenth-century European imperialist thought? How does Orientalist representation calibrate when the “exotic others” being represented are themselves Americans?
Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpretation of specific works, such as Madame Butterfly, “Chinatown, My Chinatown,” The King and I,
Sayonara, Flower Drum Song, Miss Saigon, Rising Sun, M. Butterfly, Aladdin, and Weezer’s Pinkerton. We will end the semester by considering the current state of Orientalism
in American popular culture.
This course satisfies the EDI requirement by considering diversity in relation to the representation of specific minority groups within American popular culture and the attempts
by members of those minority groups to participate in mainstream culture. We will also engage with critical theories offered by scholars for understanding the dynamics of these
representations and this cultural participation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page essays and on the quality of the student’s critical engagement with the work of his/her colleagues.

300-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 301 Modal Counterpoint (Not offered 2013-2014)
Counterpoint, the study of the ways independent melodic lines can be joined in music, has been essential to musical and compositional instruction for centuries. Counterpoint
was taught by Mozart, studied by Beethoven, and to this day remains an integral part of compositional training. The course will introduce students to species counterpoint in two
and three voices—exercises that develop discipline in polyphonic writing, hearing, and thinking. The exercises will focus on the constraints of sixteenth-century vocal polyphony
(music of Palestrina and Lassus) but will illustrate how such contrapuntal discipline is also manifest in music of Bach, Brahms and Debussy. The species exercises will lead to a
final composition project, such as the emulation of a motet in sixteenth-century style.
Evaluation will be based on written exercises and emulation projects.
Prerequisites: MUS 103 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 13).

MUS 305T (formerly 221T) Jazz Ear Training (Not offered 2013-2014)
This tutorial is designed for jazz performers, composers and arrangers who have taken Music 212 and who seek further work in the area of aural development. The focus of the
tutorial will be on the development of advanced aural skills specific to the disciplines of jazz performance and arranging/composition.
Its format will involve two weekly meetings. In the first, tutorial pairs will meet individually with the instructor to present transcriptions of approved improvised solos, which
will be thoroughly notated and performed by the students. A critique of both the performance and notation of these transcription projects will be offered by the partnered students
for one another, as well as by the instructor, with revisions and corrections incorporated into an edited performance for the entire class the following week. In the other weekly
meeting, all of the tutorial pairs will meet jointly with the instructor in order to do group assignments involving sight-singing (both rhythmic and melodic), and advanced harmonic and melodic dictation. During these sessions the instructor will offer a critique of the past week’s performances as well, based on the following criteria: 1.) notational technique,
2.) observations relating to performance practice, 3.) how such factors contributed to the evolution of the given soloists’ style, and, 4.) historical significance of the given
performance and its relationship to the overall evolution of the given performer’s personal voice.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation based on assessment of weekly assignments as described above.

MUS 371T (formerly 245T) Music Analysis: Music with Text (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The course explores the ways in which musical structure interacts with, can comment upon, and can influence one’s reading of a text set to music, and similarly, how texts set to
music can exert influence upon and guide one’s understanding of the musical structure. Using scenes from Mozart operas and selected songs of the 19th and 20th centuries (by
Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Schoenberg), the course will examine the bearing specific aspects of a text (voice, person, time, alliteration, meter, and so forth) have upon the
musical domain, and conversely, how musical structures have the ability to project or allegorize actions in the text. We will observe the often amazing ways composers of texted
music use the tonal system to create musical desires—desires that may be fulfilled, withheld, delayed, redirected, and so forth, in ways that enhance, or enact the desires of
characters in a drama or poem. In addition to the specific issues involving texted and dramatic works, the course will introduce certain techniques and insights of linear analysis—
one of the most profound developments in tonal analysis during the last century. Analysis assignments, based on the student’s close study of texted musical works, will offer the
opportunity to apply these techniques. The course will also confront the difficult issue of writing about music and will help students define and clearly express ideas about music.
Format: tutorial. Students will attend one weekly group lecture and one weekly tutorial meeting. Grades will be based on five analysis essays/presentations and five critiques of
another student’s analyses.
Prerequisites: MUS 104. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to those with the most theory background (Music 103/104, 201/202).

MUS 381(F) (formerly 215) Choral Conducting
Choral conducting techniques will be developed through exercises and projects that encompass the many facets of this activity. Using the class as the primary practice choir,
students will focus on conducting patterns applied to elements of interpretation, keyboard and vocal skills, issues of tuning and blend, rehearsal techniques, score study, and style
and repertoire. Regular videotaping of conducting sessions will provide opportunities for students to study themselves. Repertoire will include works from the early Renaissance
through the late-twentieth century, accompanied and a cappella, and issues of conducting ensembles at various skill levels will be addressed.
Format: seminar/coaching sessions. Evaluation will be based on regular conducting assignments and final projects.
Prerequisites: MUS 103 or 104. Enrollment limit: 6 (expected: 4). Preference given to upperclasses.

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music: The Music of Béla Bartók
Béla Bartók’s activities—as a composer, a comparative musicologist, a performer, a music editor, an essayist—place him at the center of many intersecting trends and issues
prevalent in the early twentieth century (e.g., the rise of nationalism, consciousness of tonality’s decline, anxiety about musical ’progress’ and the search for new means of
musical organization). The course will consider Bartók’s music in the light of his many activities, and as a lens through which we can explore both the music that shaped his
development (music of Brahms, Strauss, Debussy, Ravel, Beethoven quartets, seventeenth-century Italian keyboard music) and the musical developments that he influenced
(music of Messiaen, Lutoslawski, his influence on Jazz). We will employ a variety of means to gain insights into Bartók’s work, including the exploration of Hungarian folk
repertoire through transcription exercises, examination of manuscript drafts, consideration of Bartók’s own writings about music, and so on.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation is based on papers, projects, presentation and class participation.
Prerequisites: MUS 202, 231, 232, 233 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 14). Preference given to all senior Music majors.

NEUROSCIENCE (Div. III)
Advisory Committee: Professors: H. WILLIAMS, ZIMMERBERG***, ZOTTOLI***. Associate Professor: N. SANDSTROM. Assistant Professor: CARTER,
LEBESTKY. Affiliated faculty: HANE**.
Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the
field is apparent when surveying those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psychologists, philosophers, molecular biologists, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of single

216

neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as
memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, the use of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of
methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants and implants. Combining this wide range of approaches and research methods to study a single
remarkably complex organ—the brain—requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore
this approach.

THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two
courses, Biology 101 and Psychology 101, as part of the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken in the sophomore year. Either
Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience.
At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be
selected from other neuroscience related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to provide an integrative
culminating experience. Students take this course in the senior year.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neuroscience 493-W31-494 and write a
thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a
degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(S) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which previous
course work in specific areas in the Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex problems. The specific
goals for students in this seminar are to evaluate original research and critically examine the experimental evidence for theoretical issues in the discipline. Topics and instructional
formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of
perspectives including molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included autism, depression, stress, neurogenesis, novel neuromodulators, retrograde messengers, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory.
Format: seminar and tutorial meetings. Evaluation will be based on oral presentations, several short papers, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 14).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.
Not available for the Gaudino option.

NSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
Independent research for two semesters and a winter study under the guidance of one or more neuroscience faculty. After reviewing the literature in a specialized field of
neuroscience, students design and conduct an original research project, the results of which are reported in a thesis. Senior thesis work is supervised by the faculty participating
in the program.

PERFORMANCE STUDIES
Advisory Committee: Associate Professor: KAGAYA (Coordinator). Professors: DARROW**, D. EDWARDS*, EPPEL**, HOPPIN**, OCKMAN, W. A. SHEPPARD. Associate Professors: L. JOHNSON, MLADENOVIC. Assistant Professors: BURTON,, SANGARE. Lecturers: BROTHERS, JAFFE.
The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the making of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection
on those processes. The program has as its primary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art, creative writing, dance, film
and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature,
English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Legal Studies, Religion and Theatre. Central concepts and interactions to Performance Studies are: action, the body, presence,
ritual, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, politics, history and transcultural experience.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (LATS 230) and two of several recommended upper-level courses (AFR 305, AFR
400, ARTH 408, ARTH 461, LATS 375, WNY 310, or WNY 311).
Currently, the Program’s status is as a program without a concentration. However, students can petition and obtain a Performance Studies Contract Mayor. Students are
encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory course, which in 2009-10 is (LATS 230) Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take two advanced courses which utilizes
critical theory in relation to performance, such as (AFR 305) The Hip-Hop Generation; LATS (LATS 330) The Aesthetics of Resistance; (LATS 375) Performance and Its
Traces; (WNY 310) Art, Space and the City; (WNY 311) Imagining New York City; (AFR 400) Race, Gender, Space; (ARTH 408) Contemporary Performance Art History:
Space, Time, Action; (ARTH 461) Writing About Bodies; 3) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 4) produce projects that are a combination of art and
performance with critical thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a portfolio of their work.
As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a senior portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the
second semester of the junior year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the spring of the senior year. What we
suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic
media employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of others.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor MELISSA BARRY
Professors: CRUZ, DUDLEY*, GERRARD, SAWICKI***, WHITE. Associate Professors: BARRY, MCPARTLAND, MLADENOVIC. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI. Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow: SHADDOCK.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human
beings human? These questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most people simply as they live their
lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address
them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or prejudice. The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in
thinking about these issues, by acquainting them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these issues themselves. The program
emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences:
for example, although no contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle’s physics or biology, among philosophers there continue to be champions of Aristotle’s metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a historical background that will
acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches to philosophical issues, and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
The Philosophy major consists of nine semester courses: four required courses and five electives. The required courses are: any 100-level philosophy course, Philosophy 201
(History of Ancient Philosophy), Philosophy 202 (History of Modern Philosophy), and Philosophy 401 (Senior Seminar). The five electives are structured by a distribution
requirement. Students must take at least one course in each of three areas: Contemporary Metaphysics and Epistemology [M&E], Contemporary Value Theory [V], and History
[H]. We recommend that prospective majors take a 100-level course and Philosophy 201 or 202 by the end of their sophomore year. Courses taught in other departments at
Williams or at other institutions will not count toward the distribution requirement (Williams-Exeter tutorials may count, however, with the approval of the Department Chair).
Up to two cross-listed courses taught in other departments may count as electives toward the major. No more than one 100-level course may count toward the major.
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of
the major. The extension beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or thesis (the independent-study route) or of
additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and senior years. Juniors
interested in pursuing honors should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April. The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of
either a senior essay produced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis
(including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommendation for
graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and originality of the student’s work. The directed-study route to honors requires the
completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department revised copies of two term
papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken. Students should register for a directed study over their senior year winter study and work with an
advisor on the paper revisions. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student’s course work, the quality of the student’s
participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the submitted papers.

PHIL 109T(F) Skepticism and Relativism (W)
Intellectually, we are ready skeptics and relativists. We doubt, we point out that no one can be certain in what she believes, and we are suspicious of declarations of transcendent
reason or truth (unless they are our own). Emboldened by our confidence in skeptical arguments, we claim that knowledge is inevitably limited, that it depends on one’s perspective, and that everything one believes is relative to context or culture. No domain of inquiry is immune to this destructive skepticism and confident relativism. Science is only
“true” for some people, agnosticism is the only alternative to foolish superstition, and moral relativism and, consequently, nihilism are obvious. But is the best conclusion we can
come to with respect to our intellectual endeavors that skepticism always carries the day and that nothing at all is true? In this tutorial, we will investigate the nature of skepticism
and the varieties of relativism it encourages. Our readings will come primarily from philosophy, but will be supplemented with material from anthropology, physics, psychology,
and linguistics. We will look at relativism with respect to reason and truth in general as well as with respect to science, religion, and morality. Along the way, we will need to come
to grips with the following surprising fact. With few exceptions, thoroughgoing skepticism and relativism have not been the prevailing views of the greatest minds in the history
of philosophy. Were they simply too unsophisticated and confused to understand what is for us the irresistible power of skepticism and relativism? Or might it be that our
skepticism and relativism are the result of our own laziness and failure? Of course, this question cannot really be answered, nor is there any value in trying to answer it, and any
“answer” will only be “true” for you. Right?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every other week, and will be responsible for commenting on their tutorial partner’s work on off weeks.
Prerequisites: none; this tutorial is an appropriate first course in PHIL. Enrollment limit: 8 (expected: 8). Preference to sophomores and first-year students.

PHIL 112(F) Philosophy and Human Nature (W)
What, if anything, makes us human? Are we fundamentally rational or spiritual? Natural or social? Free or determined? Can we change what and how we are? Or is our nature
fixed? Are we basically self-interested or other directed? Do men and women share one nature? Is there a fundamental purpose to human life? Can philosophers help us answer
any of these questions today? Or have philosophical accounts of nature been surpassed by those found in the natural and social sciences? In this course we critically examine
influential philosophical accounts of human nature found in the works of figures such as Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Aquinas, Hume, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Sartre, Beauvoir,
and Foucault. Readings from the natural and social sciences may also be included.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: frequent short papers (some graded, some p/f), class participation, and one 5-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

PHIL 114(S) Freedom and Society
Freedom is one of our fundamental values as Americans. It is emphasized in our founding documents, and it remains central in our contemporary political discourse. But do we
ask: What is freedom? and Why do we value it? In this course, we will consider these questions by reading Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. We will
then turn to the question: Do we achieve freedom for all in our society today? We will read G.W.F Hegel and Karl Marx on the issue of whether workers are free, and Simone de

218

Beauvoir on whether women are free.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: a number of short position papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first- and second-year students.

PHIL 115 Personal Identity (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Through lectures, discussions, close readings and assigned writings, we will consider some of the variety of philosophical questions about the nature of persons, and personal
identity through time. Persons are subjects of experiences, have thoughts and feelings, motivation and agency; a person is thought of as continuous over time, and as related to,
recognized and respected by other persons. Thus, the concept of person plays a significant role in most branches of philosophy: metaphysics, epistemology, moral and political
philosophy, and of course in the philosophy of mind. Conceptions of person are equally important for scientific research programs (especially in psychology), for Law, and for the
arts (especially mimetic arts). Questions about persons are thus of central importance for a myriad of our theories and practices, and for the ways in which we live our lives. The
aim of this course is to explore and evaluate a number of rival conceptions of persons and personal identity over time. Some of the questions which we will discuss are: What is a
person? How do I know that I am one? What constitutes my knowledge of myself as a person, and does that knowledge differ in any significant respect from my knowledge of
physical objects and other people? What makes me the particular person that I am, and how is my identity as this individual person preserved over time?
While addressing these questions through lectures and class discussions, the course will place special emphasis on developing students’ intellectual skills in the following domains: close, analytical reading; recognizing, reconstructing and evaluating claims and reasons that support them; producing original ideas and arguments; writing clear, polished, well-argued papers.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class attendance, preparedness and participation; small group meetings; weekly short writing assignments.
No prerequisites; open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). In case of overenrollment, preference will be given to first-year students and sophomores.
Not available for the Gaudino option.

PHIL 116(S) Perception and Reality (W)
An introduction to philosophy through two of its central themes, the nature of the mind and the limits of knowledge. Topics include skepticism, the mind/body problem, reason,
knowledge of the external world, and subjectivity. Our discussions will range over historical and contemporary works, and will draw from both Western and Eastern philosophical traditions. Throughout we will pay special attention to whether and to what degree science sheds light on these issues.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation; five (4-6 page) essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

PHIL 117(F,S) Arguing about God (W)
“Faith is a fine invention,” according to Emily Dickinson’s poem, “when gentlemen can see; but microscopes are prudent in an emergency.” This introduction to philosophy will
see how far the microscopes of reason and logic can carry us in traditional arguments about the existence and nature of God. We will closely analyze classical arguments by
Augustine, Avicenna, Aquinas, Anselm, Maimonides, Descartes, and others. Pascal’s wager is a different approach: it argues that even though proof of the existence of God is
unavailable, you will maximize your expected utility by believing. We will examine the wager in its original home of Pascal’s Pensees, and look at William James’ related article,
“The Will to Believe”. The millennia old problem of whether human suffering is compatible with God’s perfection is called “the problem of evil”. We will examine this issue in
Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, classic sources and contemporary articles.
Students should be aware that, in the classic tradition, this class resembles a logic course.
Format: seminar. Requirements: frequent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

PHIL 121(F,S) Truth, Goodness and Beauty (W)
In our everyday lives, we routinely assume that our clocks can tell us the truth about what time it is, that committing murder is wrong, and that there are people, landscapes, and
works of art that are beautiful. But we are also aware that people can and often do disagree about what is true, what is good or right, and what is beautiful. Should the fact of such
disagreement lead us to conclude that truth, goodness, and beauty are in some basic sense relative to human beings, perhaps as individuals, perhaps as members of societies or
cultures? Some philosophers defend such conclusions, but others argue that truth, goodness, and beauty are “objective,” in some important sense, despite the fact that people
disagree about them. This introductory course addresses these and related issues.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, frequent short papers totaling about 30 pages, class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students and potential Philosophy majors.

PHIL 122 Philosophical Approaches to Contemporary Moral Issues (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this course we will examine a number of prominent and controversial social issues, using our study of them both as an opportunity to better understand the moral dimensions of
those issues in and of themselves, and to consider the ways in which selected classical and contemporary moral theories characterize and address those moral dimensions. Topics
will depend to some extent on student interest, but are likely to include concerns that fall under such headings as euthanasia, famine relief, abortion, capital punishment, terrorism
and torture, food ethics, environmental ethics, and the like. Writing assignments will employ a “target essay” approach that involves writing groups in which students share their
work with each other. For each issue we cover in class, one student in each group will write a five to seven page “target essay” on an assigned topic; all of the remaining members
of each group will then read that essay and write a two page response to it. Depending on the number of students in the class, each person will write either one or two target essays,
as well as four or five response essays throughout the course of the term. In addition, students will be required to substantially revise and expand one target essay in light of the
peer response papers and written comments from the instructor, and to submit it as a final paper for the course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class attendance and participation, four or five short response papers (h/p/f, 2 pages each), one or two target essays (graded, 5-7 pages
each), and one revised final essay (7-10 pages).

PHIL 123(F,S) Objectivity in Ethics (W)
It is often claimed that morality is subjective or just a matter of opinion. In this course we’ll examine several influential attempts to provide a rational foundation for morality,
along with Nietzsche’s wholesale rejection of these efforts. Readings will include work by Plato, Hobbes, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, and contemporary authors.

PHIL 126 Paradoxes (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
There are three grains of sand on my desk. This is unfortunate, but at least there isn’t a heap of sand on my desk. That would be really worrisome. On the other hand, there is a
heap of sand in my backyard. I don’t know how exactly how many grains of sand are in this heap, but let’s say 100,000. My daughter removes one grain of sand. I don’t know
why, she just does. It seems like there is still a heap of sand in my backyard. In fact, it seems like you can’t change a heap of sand into something that isn’t a heap of sand by
removing one grain of sand. Right? But now we have a problem. By repeated application of the same reasoning, it seems that even after she removes 99,997 grains of sand-I
don’t know what she wants with all this sand, but I’m starting to worry about that girl-there is still a heap of sand in my backyard. But three grains isn’t enough for a heap. So there
is not a heap in my backyard. Now I’m confused. Where did my reasoning go wrong?
What we have here is an example of the sorites paradox. It is a paradox, because I started with seemingly true statements and used valid reasoning to arrive at contradictory
conclusions. We can learn a lot about logic, language, epistemology and metaphysics by thinking through and attempting to resolve paradoxes. In this class, we’ll work together
to think through some ancient and contemporary paradoxes. We’ll also work on writing lucid prose that displays precisely the logical structure of arguments, engages in focused
critique of these arguments, and forcefully presents arguments of our own. Other topics could include: Zeno’s paradoxes of motion and plurality, the liar’s paradox, the surprise
exam paradox, paradoxes of material constitution, Newcomb’s Problem, and the Prisoner’s Dilemma.
This is an introductory course.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short writing assignments and a longer final paper

PHIL 201(F) History of Ancient Greek Philosophy (Same as CLAS 203)
Very few people believe that everything is water, that we knew everything before birth, that philosophers ought to rule the state, or that some people are natural slaves. Why then
should we spend our time studying people who in addition to having these surprising beliefs have been dead for 2500 years? First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and
Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some

219

familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of
the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these
problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through
fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato’s dialogues, examining Plato’s portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception. We will then read some of Aristotle’s works on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, considering some of the
ways Aristotle’s thought responds to that of predecessors.

PHIL 202(S) History of Modern Philosophy
European philosophy in 17th and 18th centuries both responded to, and shaped in its turn, major revolutions in scientific and political thought. The legacy of this intellectually
fertile period is still felt in contemporary epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political philosophy. We will consider some of the questions that are both central to the modern
era and philosophically important today: What are the origins, nature and limits of human knowledge? How should scientific inquiry proceed? What is the nature of reality, and
how can it be known? What is the relationship between the mind and the body? How should we think about causality in the material world, and how about causality that involves
persons as agents? Are we free or determined? Are there compelling reasons to be moral? What is the nature of moral thinking and acting? How can our social and political
institutions be explained and justified? We will read a necessarily limited selection of writings by the most important thinkers of the modern period: Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes,
Locke, Berkeley, Leibniz, Hume, Reid, Rousseau and Kant.
Format: lecture with some discussions. Requirements: class attendance and preparedness; participation in weekly discussion groups, with rotating short reports on these meetings; 8 short assignments; a midterm and a final exam.

PHIL 203(S) (formerly 103) Logic and Language (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference between good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We
all examine the virtues and vices of good arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to improve the critical thinking of the students, to introduce
them to sentential and predicate logic, to familiarize them with enough formal logic to enable them to read some of the great works of philosophy, which use formal logic (such as
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus), and to examine some of the connections between logic and philosophy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.

PHIL 205 (formerly 201) Continental Philosophy: Reading the Critics of Reason (Not offered 2013-2014)
Nineteenth- and twentieth-century European philosophy gave rise to an astounding number of brilliant thinkers (including Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Arendt, Lacan,
Adorno, Gadamer, Habermas, Irigaray, Deleuze, and Derrida), who in turn initiated an equally astounding number of important philosophical movements (including existentialism, structuralism, critical theory, hermeneutics, French feminism, and post-structuralism). Fortunately, this bewildering diversity comprises a recognizable tradition in virtue of a
common theme: the relentless critique of the conceptions and projects of reason inherited from the Enlightenment, Kant, and Hegel. Unfortunately, because many of these
critiques are written in ways that attempt to undermine and transform our notions of rationality, they can be maddeningly difficult to read.
This course will introduce students to continental philosophy through guided readings of these challenging texts aimed at developing students interpretative skills.

PHIL 207(S) Contemporary Philosophy of Mind (W)
The philosophy of mind has been one of the liveliest and most active areas of philosophical inquiry over the last century, and it has taken a place at the center of the field. Part of
the explanation for this is the rise of compelling scientific accounts of who and what we are. The question of whether the mind can be fully understood within a physicalist,
materialist framework has taken on an exciting urgency. In this course we will investigate the mind/body problem, mental representation, the conceptual and nonconceptual
content of mental states, and the nature of consciousness. Throughout we will attend to the relevant empirical literature.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly two page papers on focused topics and two 8- to 10-page papers.
Prerequisites: at least one prior 100 or 200 level PHIL course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 14). Preference given to prospective majors in philosophy and concentrators in

PHIL 208(S) Philosophy of Education: DuBois versus Washington
At the beginning of the last century Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois engaged in a great debate about the nature of education. Their dispute raised some of the deepest
questions in philosophy: consequentialism versus deontology, the goals of happiness versus dignity, long term versus short term goals, and more. We will begin with Washington’s classic article “Industrial Education for the Negro” and DuBois’ classic “The Talented Tenth”. We will continue with J. S. Mill’s Utilitarianism and Kant’s Grounding for
the Metaphysics of Morals, considering these books as works in the philosophy of education. We will read the great 20th century philosopher who saw education as the foundation of democracy: John Dewey. We will also study contemporary philosophers who have written on education, such as Martha Nussbaum and Cornel West.

PHIL 209(F) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our time and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of the world, and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins,
grounds, and nature of this belief. We will analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of scientific theories, scientific choice, change,
and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive.
The course will begin with the “received view” of science, advanced by logical empiricists, which assumes the objectivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss
philosophies of science which emerged out of various criticisms of this view—especially those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend—and the challenges to the assumptions of scientific objectivity and rationality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the relativist and social-constructivist views developed within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will analyze the current debate about cognitive credentials of science and proper approach to the study of science, which came to be known as
“the science wars.”
Format: seminar, with a short lecture component in each class. Requirements: class attendance, preparedness and participation; three short assignments; three 5 pages long
papers, the last of which will be the final paper, due a week after the end of classes.
Prerequisites: one PHIL course, or declared major in a natural science, or consent of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-15). Preference will be given to declared

PHIL 212 Ethics and Reproductive Technologies (Same as WGSS 212) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In her groundbreaking book, The Tentative Pregnancy, Barbara Katz Rothman writes that “[t]he technological revolution in reproduction is forcing us to confront the very
meaning of motherhood, to examine the nature and origins of the mother-child bond, and to replace—or to let us think we can replace—chance with choice.” Taking this as our
starting point, in this course we will examine a number of conceptual and ethical issues in the use and development of technologies related to human reproduction, drawing out
their implications for such core concepts as “motherhood” and “parenthood,” family and genetic relatedness, exploitation and commodification, and reproductive rights and
society’s interests in reproductive activities. Topics will range from consideration of “mundane” technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), prenatal genetic screening and
testing, and surrogacy, to the more extraordinary, including pre-implantation diagnosis (PID), post-menopausal reproduction, post-mortem gamete procurement, reproductive
cloning and embryo splitting, and in utero medical interventions. Background readings include sources rooted in traditional modes of bioethical analysis as well as those incorporating feminist approaches.
Format: discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, four to five short reflection papers, and two longer papers ( 5-10 pages).

PHIL 213T(F) Biomedical Ethics (W)
Much like the construction of medical knowledge itself, it is from specific cases that general principles of biomedical ethics arise and are systematized into a theoretical framework, and it is to cases they must return, if they are to be both useful and comprehensible to those making decisions within the biomedical context. In this tutorial we will exploit
this characteristic of biomedical ethics by using a case-based approach to examining core concepts of the field. The first portion of the course will be devoted to developing and
understanding four moral principles which have come to be accepted as canonical: respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The remainder of the course
will consider key concepts at the core of medical ethics and central issues for the field, such as privacy and confidentiality, the distinction between killing and “letting die,”
therapy vs. research, and enhancement vs. therapy. To this end, each week we will (1) read philosophical material focused on one principle or concept, and (2) consider in detail
one bioethics case in which the principle or concept has special application or relevance. In some weeks, students will be asked to choose from a small set which case they would
like to address; in others the case will be assigned. Students will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately one hour per week, writing and presenting 5- to 7-page essays
every other week, and commenting orally on partners’ essays in alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral critiques.

themes and moral inquiry. Topics will include animal minds and cognition, empathy and evolution, the history of domestication, animal rights, cross-cultural views on animals,
arguments against and for vegetarianism and veganism, and pets and happiness.

feminist revisions (including those by woman of color) of traditional and contemporary emancipatory theories such as liberalism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, poststructuralism,
and queer theory as well as transnational feminism. Authors read may include the following: Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alexandra Kollantai, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Jacobs, Emma Goldman, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Adrienne Rich, Marilyn Frye, Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, Catherine MacKinnon, Judith
Butler, Iris Young, Nancy Fraser, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Chandra Mohanty. We conclude the course with an exploration of the wide range of feminist analyses of

PHIL 227 Death and Dying (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this course we will examine traditional philosophical approaches to understanding death and related concepts, with a special focus on the ethical concerns surrounding death
and care for the dying. We will begin with questions about how to define death, as well as reflections on its meaning and function in human life. We will move on to examine
ethical issues of truth-telling with terminally ill patients and their families, decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments, the care of seriously ill newborns, physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia, and posthumous interests. In addition to key concepts of death, dying, and terminal illness, we will develop and refine notions of medical futility,
paternalism and autonomy, particularly within the context of advance directives and surrogate decision making.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class attendance and participation, periodic short essays (3 or 4 total, 2-3 pages each), two mid-length papers (5-7 pages each); possible experiential learning component.

PHIL 228(S) Feminist Bioethics (Same as WGSS 228) (W) (D)
In this course we’ll explore the ways in which feminist approaches to moral thinking have influenced both the methodology and the content of contemporary bioethics. The first
portion of the course will address the emergence of the “Ethics of Care,” critically assessing its origins in feminist theory, its development within the context of the caring
professions, and its potential as a general approach to bioethical reasoning. The second portion of the course will use feminist philosophy to inform our understanding of the ways
in which gender structures the individual’s interactions with the health care system. To do this we’ll explore topics that might traditionally be considered “women’s issues” in
health care, such as medicine and body image (e.g., cosmetic surgery, eating disorders), reproductive and genetic technologies, and research on women and their health care
needs. In addition we’ll also look at feminist analyses of topics that traditionally have not been regarded as “gendered,” such as resource allocation and end of life issues. As a
course offered under the Exploring Diversity Initiative, this class is designed to improve students’ ability to recognize both the existence and the effects of gender disparities
within the health care context, and in particular, how power and privilege within and beyond medicine contribute to gender inequalities in health and medical treatment. Moreover, students will theorize about ways of conceptualizing and of reforming health care interactions in order to reduce or eliminate those gender inequalities.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length papers (7-10 pp. each), one oral presentation, and periodic short writing
assignments (four or five, app. 2 pp. each).

PHIL 235T Morality and Partiality: Loyalty, Friendship, Patriotism (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The aim of this tutorial is to critically examine the nature, importance, and ethical value of personal attachments and loyalties. Loyalty is frequently expected by family, friends
and lovers, and demanded by institutions, religious and political communities, as well as by the state. A person incapable of loyalty is often characterized as fickle, cold, self-serving and sometimes even pathological. However, the status of loyalty as a virtue has always been suspect: it has been argued that it is incompatible with impartiality, fairness and
equality, and claimed that it is always exclusionary. So, some relationships with other people—such as friendships, familial ties, love, patriotism—seem to be ethically desirable,
central to the quality of our lives, and yet prima facie in tension with the widely held belief that morality requires impartiality and equal treatment of all human beings. Are we
ever justified in having more concern, and doing more, for our friends, family, community or nation? Does morality require that we always subordinate our personal relationships
to universal principles? Is patriotism incompatible with cosmopolitanism, and if so, which of the two should we value? If loyalty is a virtue, what are the proper limits of its
cultivation and expression?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: tutorial pairs will meet with the instructor for one hour a week; each student will write a 5-page paper every second week, and comment on the
tutorial partner’s paper on alternate weeks; no final paper; the final grade will be based on the cumulative quality of papers (which will not be individually graded), quality of the

PHIL 236(F) Contemporary Ethical Theory (W)
Is sacrificing an individual’s welfare for the sake of the community ever justified, or does each individual have an inviolable status that must be respected? Should moral considerations always take priority over personal projects and intimate relationships, or are there some spheres in which we should be free to pursue our goals without concern for
morality? We will explore these and related questions by systematically comparing the two dominant ethical theories of the 20th century, consequentialism and deontology.
While both find their roots in earlier thinkers—consequentialism in Mill and Sidgwick, deontology in Kant—our focus will be on contemporary developments of these views.
We’ll conclude by examining contractualism, which attempts to transcend the divide between consequentialist and deontological views. Readings include works by Bentham,
Mill, Nozick, Railton, Brink, Williams, Wolf, Taurek, Rawls, Smart, Scheffler, Nagel, Kant, Kamm, Quinn, Kagan, Ross, and Scanlon.

PHIL 271T Woman as “Other” (Same as WGSS 271T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D) (W)
At mid-century, Simone de Beauvoir, existential philosopher and perhaps the greatest feminist theorist of the twentieth century, described woman as “living in a world where men
compel her to assume the status of the Other.” At the same time, Beauvoir asserts: “One is not born a woman, one becomes one.” How, given their objectification, can women
become subjects for themselves? Is authenticity even possible? Must the relation between self and other inevitably be one of objectification and domination? Is reciprocity and
mutuality in self-other relations possible? In our efforts to deepen our understanding of these important philosophical questions, questions that have been at the center of social
and political thought at least since Hegel introduced the dialectic of master and slave, we will engage in close readings of writings by Beauvoir (including autobiography and
biography), as well as philosophers responding to her—Frantz Fanon, Luce Irigary and Judith Butler.
Format: tutorial. Students will work in pairs. Requirements: each student will write and present orally a 5-page essay every other week. Students not presenting essays will

PHIL 272T Free Will and Responsibility (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In moral and legal decisions we hold people responsible for their deliberate actions. This practice seems justified as long as people are free to make the choices that they do. But
which criteria must a decision meet in order to qualify as free? Clearly, a free decision must not be the result of external coercion. But must the decision also be free from any
outside influence at all? If so then freedom may seem impossible, for we are all deeply influenced by external factors ranging from the general laws of nature to specific features
of our genetic endowment and social environment including religion, political ideology, and advertising. These affect not only our particular choices but also, more fundamentally, who we are and what we value. Since it is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced by such forces, the real question is whether, and how, free choice is possible amidst all
of these influences. In this course we will examine the best-known recent philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and responsibility. Since these issues
have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we should accept, we will also examine influential theories of punishment. Our focus will be on works by contemporary authors. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation and oral argument as well as critical reasoning and writing.
Format: tutorial; students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week. Requirements: each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and

PHIL 274T(S) Messing with People: The Ethics of Human Experimentation (W)
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Stanley Milgram’s Obedience experiments are infamous. Yet, other lesser known experiments are equally important landmarks in research
ethics, as well, such as the Willowbrook experiment, in which residents of a state home for mentally impaired children were intentionally infected with a virus that causes
hepatitis, and the Kennedy-Krieger Lead Abatement study, which tested the efficacy of a new lead paint removal procedure by housing young children in partially decontaminated homes and testing those children for lead exposure. In this sophomore tutorial we’ll closely examine a series of contemporary and historical cases of human experimentation (roughly, one case per week) with an eye toward elucidating the moral norms that ought to govern human subjects research. A number of conceptual themes will emerge
throughout the course of the term, including notions of exploitation and coercion, privacy and confidentiality, and the balance between public interests and individual rights.
Specific issues will include the ethics of placebo research, deception in research, studies of illicit/illegal behavior, genetic research, experimentation with children, pregnant
women and fetuses, and persons with diminished mental capacity, among other topics.
Format: tutorial; students will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately 75 minutes per week, writing and presenting 5- to 7-page essays every other week, and commenting orally on their partners’ essays in alternate weeks.

PHIL 280 Frege, Russell, and the Early Wittgenstein (Not offered 2013-2014)
The last line of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus famously reads: “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” Are there things that cannot be put into words? What
are the limits of language? What is the nature of language? How do logic and language relate? We will examine these (and other questions) in the context of the great philosophical revolution at the beginning of the last century: the linguistic turn and the birth of analytic philosophy. We will see how a focus on language affects our understanding of many
traditional philosophical questions, ranging from epistemology and metaphysics to aesthetics and ethics. Our texts will include Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic,
Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
While you’re debating whether to take this class, consider the following puzzle. There is a village where the barber shaves (a) all those and (b) only those who do not shave
themselves. Now, ask yourself: who shaves the barber? You will see that if the barber does not shave himself, then by condition (a) he does shave himself. And, if the barber does

PHIL 281T(S) Philosophy of Religion (Same as REL 302T) (W)
Our goal in this course will be to try to determine how far reason can justify belief in God. We will spend at least half of the semester examining the best-known philosophical
arguments for and against the existence of God (including the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, the argument from religious experience, the argument from evil, and the argument from religious disagreement). For each one, we will first look at historically important formulations of the argument and then turn
to contemporary reformulations. Our aim will be to identify and then evaluate the strongest version of each argument. After working through these arguments, we will reflect
more generally on the proper roles of reason and faith in justifying religious belief. In the final section of the course we will examine the relationship between god and morality.
Authors will include Plato, Anselm, Aquinas, Pascal, Paley, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Freud, Marx, and several contemporary philosophers.
Format: tutorial; emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation and oral argument as well as critical reasoning and writing. Requirements: students meet
with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week; each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and comment on his or her tutorial partner’s paper in
alternate weeks.
Prerequisite: one PHIL course, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected : 10). Preference given to current and prospective Philosophy majors.

PHIL 289T Socrates (Same as CLAS 289T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Socrates was executed in 399 BCE on the charges of impiety and corruption of the youth of Athens. Apparently he corrupted the youth by engaging with them in philosophy. In
this class, we will attempt to carry on the noble tradition of corruption by philosophy. We will read works by three of Socrates’ contemporaries: Aristophanes, Xenophon, and
especially Plato. Through an examination of these works, we will try to get some feeling for what Socrates’ controversial positions and his arguments for these positions may
have been. While he never wrote any philosophical works of his own, Socrates is one of the most influential thinkers in the western tradition. His thought influenced the thought
of subsequent generations of philosophers. In fact, Socrates seems to have been thought of as a kind of intellectual saint in the Hellenistic world. The stoics and skeptics both
claimed a Socratic imprimatur for their own thought. Stoicism and skepticism, however, are wildly divergent schools of thought. How could proponents of each be claiming to
follow in the footsteps of Socrates? We will read some representative works from each of these schools of thought to see how each approaches Socrates. If time permits, we may
also look at how the figure of Socrates has been thought about in the works of more modern thinkers.

PHIL 291T Violence: Its Trajectory and Its Causes (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This tutorial examines Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of our Nature. Why Violence Has Declined (2011). We focus first on the controversial theses that—despite two world
wars and the Holocaust—the twentieth century was not the most violent so far, and that, over the entire course of history, human beings have become decreasingly violent. We
then turn to the book’s explanations of the factors it identifies as leading us to be violent—our “inner demons”—and as curbing our violence—our “better angels.”

PHIL 294T Philosophy and Narrative Fiction (Same as COMP 294T) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
What is it for a novel, a story, a play or a film to be a philosophical narrative? It is not enough for it merely to be about a character who happens to be a philosopher; nor is it just
that philosophical positions are reviewed in the narrative, as in Gaarder’s Sophie’s World. Milan Kundera tried to answer this question by saying that a good philosophical novel
does not serve philosophy but, on the contrary, tries to “get hold of a domain that (...) philosophy had kept for itself. There are metaphysical problems, problems of human
existence, that philosophy has never known how to grasp in all their concreteness and that only the novel can seize.” If Kundera is right, fictional narratives (such as novels)
sometimes do the philosophical work that philosophy cannot do for itself. What kind of work is that, and how is it accomplished? Why can’t argumentative prose—philosophers’
preferred form of expression—clearly say, and moreover prove, what literature, theatre and film illustrate, show and display? One possible answer which we will examine is that,
while many philosophers recognize that there are intimate connections between what we believe, feel and do, philosophical argumentation by its very nature appeals to belief
alone; narrative art, by contrast, can simultaneously engage our reason, emotions, imagination and will, thus resulting not only in deepening our understanding, but also in
transformation of the self.
To properly address a number of interrelated questions concerning philosophy in literature and film, and philosophical problems of meaning, interpretation and evaluation of
narrative fiction, we will discuss both narrative works of art and theoretical approaches to their analysis. We will consider the ways in which narrative fiction presents and engages
its audience in philosophical reflections on personal identity, nature of the self, interpersonal relationships, memory, time, human existence, freedom, and the meaning in life.
The works to be discussed and analyzed in the tutorial meetings will be by some of the following writers and directors: Kafka, Dostoyevsky, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Camus, Thomas
Mann, Borges, Kundera, Ecco, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Resnais, Kurosawa, Bunuel and Kubrick. The theoretical aspect of the course will involve close readings of selected articles
in contemporary philosophy of language, mind and action; in contemporary philosophy of literature and philosophy of film; and in contemporary narratology.
Format: tutorial, involving a three-way discussion among tutorial partners and the instructor. Requirements: all students will attend Monday evening film screenings and discussions. Tutorial pairs will meet with the instructor for one hour a week; each student will write a 5-page paper every second week, and comment on the tutorial partner’s paper on
alternate weeks.
No prerequisites; open to first year students. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). In the case of overenrollment, preference will be given to students seriously committed to the

PHIL 301 Textual Meaning and Interpretation (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Early philosophy of language focused on meaning of assertions, denials and descriptions. However, this approach is too narrow, since people use language to do a myriad of
things: to ask, demand, promise, praise, blame, threaten, command, insinuate, evoke, express feelings, and sometimes just to play. The philosophical study of what we do in
language, and how we understand one another, is called pragmatics; within the analytic tradition, the main philosophical contributions to the study of pragmatics in language
came from Peirce, Wittgenstein, Austen, Grice and Searle. Other philosophers and literary theorists have used some of their ideas recently to throw light on the nature of textual
meaning and the interpretation of literary texts. We shall first explore the salient features of the pragmatic approaches to language, paying special attention to Austin’s notion of
illocutionary force and Grice’s notion of non-natural meaning. We will then examine how these notions may be exploited in the consideration of various long-standing issues in
the theory of literary interpretation. We will discuss the importance of specific genre conventions and broader contextual matters to the interpretation of literary texts (along the
lines suggested by Quentin Skinner); the possibility of using intention to rule out mistaken and arrive at acceptable interpretations, if not a single correct interpretation (a possibility denied by such relativists as Stanley Fish); the use and meaning of metaphors; and the host of questions surrounding the “intentional fallacy” (the alleged result of invoking
authorial intention to determine textual meaning).
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, 10 short weekly response papers, and 2 longer (5-7 page) papers.

PHIL 305 Existentialism and Phenomenology (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
According to Jean-Paul Sartre, the only philosopher to ever refer to himself as an “existentialist,” existence precedes essence. What is essential to human being is not any fixed set
of characteristics, but rather what a human being becomes and how it defines and creates itself under conditions it does not choose. In this course we address key themes and
figures from two of the most influential movements in twentieth century European philosophy, namely, existentialism and phenomenology, a philosophical approach to which
existentialism is indebted. We will discuss major works (philosophical, literary, visual) by such figures as Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de
Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Richard Wright, Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Luc Godard. We will raise questions concerning the task of philosophy, the
structure and meaning constituting function of consciousness, the relationship between self and other, the mind-body relationship, freedom, authenticity, and absurdity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short critical response papers, occasional short class presentations based on outlines of the text, and three 5- to 6-page papers. Students will be
required to re-write one of the three papers in lieu of a final exam.
Prerequisites: PHIL 101 or 102 or 240 or 271T or 304T or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to majors and those considering a

PHIL 307(F) Spinoza: Ethics, Politics and Actuality (W)
The course will consist in a reading of Spinoza’s Ethics together with his two political works A Theologico-Political Treatise and A Political Treatise, thus establishing an
intersection between ethics, metaphysics and political philosophy and taking its point of departure in the relation between knowledge and passion. Spinoza defines the human
essence as “conatus”—a certain degree of power (potentia), characterized by its perseverance in existence. Mankind’s path to freedom and self-understanding is grounded in the
analysis of the conditions characterizing the different types of knowledge: the immediate, the rational and reflecting, and the intuitive. However, in all three kinds of knowledge,
affectivity is central—hence, also the body. The Spinozian ethics, against the backdrop of a complete metaphysical system, makes possible an understanding of identity as
something constituted in continuous relation to the rest of the world—human, natural and material. It is through its capacity of being affected that the individual human power is
expressed, and is able to exist as a form of freedom. The ethics, understood in this way, also makes possible an understanding of the political as the necessary organization of
human coexistence, and as the dealing with individual and collective passions. Finally, we will also address contemporary Spinozism as found namely in the philosophical works
of Gilles Deleuze, Étienne Balibar and Antonio Negri. The main texts will be combined with shorter articles or book chapters from contemporary Spinoza commentaries.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in group discussions, oral presentations , 4–5 short papers, and a final 8–10 page paper.
Prerequisites: at least one previous course in philosophy, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 5-15). Preference given to Philosophy, Political Science, and

PHIL 308 Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (Not offered 2013-2014)
Bertrand Russell claimed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was “perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived—passionate, profound,
intense, and dominating.” Wittgenstein’s two masterpieces, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations, stand like opposing poles around which
schools of twentieth-century analytic philosophy revolve. The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus is known as the “earlier Wittgenstein,” the Wittgenstein of the Investigations is
known as the “later Wittgenstein.” This course is an intensive, line-by-line study of the Investigations—one of the greatest (and thus, one of the most controversial) books in the
history of philosophy. Aside from its overwhelming influence on 20- and 21st-century philosophy and intellectual culture, any book which contains the remark, “if a lion could
talk, we could not understand him,” deserves serious attention.

PHIL 315(F) Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason

PHIL 320 Recent Continental Feminist Theory (Same as WGSS 321) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course explores developments in recent feminist thought influenced by philosophical currents in France and Germany (poststructuralism and critical theory.) Depending
upon the year in which the course is offered, we explore topics such as self and society, sexual difference, embodiment, critiques of reason, the psyche, new materialist theories,
queer feminism, and transnational feminism. We will read from works by authors such as the following; Sandra Bartky, Iris Young, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Grosz, Luce Irigaray,
Jessica Benjamin, Gayle Rubin, Rosi Braidotti, Eve Sedgwick, Lynne Huffer, Sara Ahmed, Jasbir Puar, and Wendy Brown. Fiction and film may also be included.

PHIL 321T(F) Critical Theory: The Enlightenment and its Critics (Same as WGSS 322T) (D) (W)

“Dare to know! Have courage to use your own reason—that is the motto of Enlightenment.” Thus the 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant exhorts his contemporaries to muster the courage to cultivate their capacity for reason. Modern faith in the prospects of universal human dignity, rational autonomy, the rights of man, individual
liberty, democracy, open scientific inquiry and social and political progress depend upon it. Yet in 19th and 20th centuries we find the promise of Enlightenment tempered by the
rise of nationalism and the persistence of racism, sexism, genocide, terrorism, and religious extremism as well as the emergence of wars of mass destruction, environmental
degradation, and the potential for manipulation of populations by consumerist mass media. Can the promise of Enlightenment be redeemed?
In this tutorial we begin with short readings by Kant, Hegel and Marx, key sources for critical social theory in the 20th century. Possible other figures read may include: Max
Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Jurgen Habermas, Nancy Fraser, Amy Allen, Noelle McAfee, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Grosz, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, and Gilles Deleuze, Georgio Agamben, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said and Achille Mbembe, as well as current critiques of neoliberal capitalism.
Although we will not directly address diversity issues except insofar as cultural, racial, class, sexual and other differences are bound up within power or domination relations,
insofar as the course examines social and political power, oppression and domination, and the possibility or viability of the idea of human emancipation it meets the EDI requirement. This tutorial will be adapted for WGSS students seeking to meet a theory requirement.
Format: tutorial, students will work in pairs and meet for 75 minutes each week with the professor. Requirements: each student will write and present a 5- to 6-page paper every
other week and a commentary on his or her partner’s essay on alternate weeks. Evaluations are based on written work as well as level of preparation and intellectual engagement

PHIL 322T(S) Hume’s “Treatise of Human Nature” (W)
Hume’s Treatise, one of the greatest books in the history of philosophy, still exerts a considerable influence on contemporary epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics and moral
psychology. Unfortunately, the relevance this work for particular philosophical disciplines has too often led to a piece-meal reading of Treatise: its three books (”Of the Understanding”, “Of the Passions” and “Of Morals”) are typically considered in isolation from one another. Epistemologists don’t seem to think that Hume’s account of human emotions, morality and taste can in any way illuminate his treatment of skepticism and natural belief, while moral philosophers often neglect Hume’s conclusions about the limits of
our knowledge in analyzing his conception of motivation, action, obligation and virtue. In contrast with this interpretive tendency, this tutorial will focus on Hume’s “science of
human nature”—his overall philosophical project in Treatise—and cultivate the discussion of different philosophical issues and arguments in light of the general aims of the work
as a whole.
We will situate Hume’s project within the historical tradition in which he thought and against which Treatise was directed. For clarification and discussion of the points made in
Treatise, we will read parts of Hume’s later works, especially the two Enquiries. Throughout the course, our reading of Hume will be supplemented by historical and interpretive
essays on his work. Our focus will be on three broad interrelated issues: Hume’s conception of theoretical rationality, his conception of practical rationality, and his views about
the role and relevance of non-rational (on some readings, irrational) elements in a good life of a wise person.
Format: tutorial; one two-hours long seminar meeting in the first week of classes; in subsequent weeks, tutorial pairs will meet with the instructor for 75 minutes a week. Requirements: each student will write a 5 page paper every second week, and comment on the tutorial partner’s paper on alternate weeks; in the last week of classes, we will meet again
for a two hours long seminar, for which all students will write a paper.

debates about the significance of his work: Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality (vols. 1-3), and selected interviews and course lectures. We examine debates in the
Foucault literature about freedom, power, ethics, and the nature of critical theory. This course has been designated EDI because it engages questions concerning power, social

PHIL 330 Plato (Same as CLAS 330) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Plato is one of the most important and influential thinkers in the history of the western tradition. His depiction of the trial and death of Socrates is one of the classics of western
literature, and his views on ethics and politics continue to occupy a central place in our discussions 2400 years after they were written. It is, in fact, quite difficult to get through
any course of study in the liberal arts without some familiarity with Plato. Nevertheless, comparatively few people realize that the views we commonly think of as “Platonic”
represent only one strand in Plato’s thought. For example, we commonly attribute to Plato a theory of the Forms on the basis of his claims in the so-called “middle dialogues”
(mainly Republic, Phaedo, and Symposium). However, in his philosophically more sophisticated and notoriously difficult later dialogues (such as the Parmenides, Philebus,
Sophist and Statesman), Plato engages in radical criticism and revision of his earlier views. In this course, we will spend the first third of the semester attempting to understand the
metaphysics and epistemology in Plato’s middle dialogues. We will spend the balance of the semester coming to grips with Plato’s arguments in the later dialogues. We will read
several complete dialogues in translation, and will also read a wide variety of secondary source material.
Format: lecture/discussion. This class will be a roughly equal mixture of lectures, student presentations, and seminar discussion. Requirements: students will be expected to
prepare a seminar presentation, to write several focused short analytical pieces, and to write a 15- to 20-page term paper in multiple drafts.
Prerequisites: PHIL 101, PHIL 102 or permission of instructor. (A prior course in logic will be extremely helpful, but is not necessary.) Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

PHIL 331T Contemporary Epistemology (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Epistemology is one of the core areas of philosophical reflection. In this course, we will study the literature in contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowledge and rational
belief. Epistemologists seek answers to the following kinds of questions: When is it rational to have a particular belief? What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)? In order
to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in holding that belief? What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge? These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth and avoiding falsity. Beyond this common ground, however, epistemologists are much
divided. Some maintain that these issues are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods. Others maintain that these questions will only yield to methods
that incorporate our broader insight into the nature of the world including, perhaps, feminist thought or science. Both stances face severe difficulties. Further, even where there is
agreement as to the proper way of answering epistemological questions, there is a stunning variety of possible answers to each question.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (6 in all) and comment on his or her tutorial partner’s paper in alternate weeks.
Prerequisites: at least one upper-level PHIL course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 6). Preference given to current and prospective Philosophy

PHIL 332(S) Aristotle’s Metaphysics (Same as CLAS 332) (W)
In this course we will study Aristotle’s Metaphysics concentrating of books gamma-theta. Aristotle sets out to study being qua being, or what is insofar as it is. The thoughts that
Aristotle expresses in these books were instrumental in setting an intellectual agenda that dominated western thought through the Middle Ages and provided the backdrop against
which the modern philosophical tradition arose. Furthermore, many of the issues that Aristotle takes up in these books remain of central importance in contemporary philosophy.
Our main goal in this course will be to work our way carefully through Aristotle’s difficult text and to reconstruct his central positions and arguments for these positions. We will
also read selections from the vast secondary literature on Aristotle’s Metaphysics.

PHIL 334 Greek and Roman Ethics (Same as CLAS 334) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Most thoughtful human beings spend a good deal of time musing about how we ought to live. The philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome were among the first thinkers to
develop rigorous arguments in response to such musings. While ancient scientific theories and the philosophical systems constructed in accordance with these theories might be
of interest only to scholars of the ancient world, the moral philosophy produced in Greece and Rome remains as relevant today as it was when it was written. In this course, we
will closely examine some central texts in ancient moral philosophy. We will begin by reading several of Plato’s early dialogues and the entirety of his Republic. We will then turn
to Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, as well as selections from his Eudemian Ethics, Magna Moralia and Politics. Finally we will examine some central texts in the Stoic and
Epicurean traditions, as well as some of Cicero’s contributions to moral philosophy. We will pay special attention to how different thinkers conceive of the nature of happiness,
the nature of virtue, and the relation between the two. We will also spend a good deal of time thinking about the moral psychology of the thinkers we read.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short response pieces, two 10-page papers which will involve substantial revision in light of instructor feedback, active participation in

PHIL 335 Contemporary Metaethics (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
We often speak as if moral judgments can be true or false, well-reasoned or not. But how should objectivity in this domain be understood? Is moral objectivity like scientific
objectivity, assuming we have a clear sense of what that involves? If not, should that concern us? Are there other models for understanding moral objectivity besides science?
While answers to such questions are implicit in historically important accounts of morality, these issues became the topic of explicit, sustained debate in the twentieth century.
Our focus will be on the most recent and sophisticated work in this area. We will examine several different approaches in depth, including realism, constructivism, expressivism,
and skepticism. Readings will include works by Moore, Stevenson, Harman, Mackie, Railton, Boyd, Blackburn, Williams, McDowell, Korsgaard, and Nagel.

PHIL 337T Justice in Health Care (Not offered 2013-2014)
Justice is a notoriously complex and elusive philosophical concept, the conditions of which are even more difficult to articulate within real world institutions and contexts than in
the abstract. In this course we’ll explore justice as a fundamental moral principle and as a desideratum of the US health care system. The first portion of the course will be devoted
to considering general theories of justice as well as alternative conceptions of justice within the health care context. This will provide the background for subsequent examination
of specific topics, which may include, among others: justice in health care financing and reform, which may itself include an analysis of the Affordable Care Act; justice in health
care rationing, with particular attention to the relationship between rationing criteria and gender, “race,” disability, and age; justice in the procurement and allocation of organs for
transplantation; AIDS and personal responsibility for illness; and justice in medical research, including “double standards” for research conducted in less developed countries.

PHIL 378 Pragmatist Currents in Contemporary Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
American Pragmatism left a deep legacy in contemporary epistemology and the philosophy of science, but it is—more often than not—a legacy difficult to disentangle from
other intellectual influences. Consequently, many philosophers deeply influenced by pragmatism do not recognize the fact, while, on the other hand, some self-proclaimed
pragmatists of our days can hardly be seen as continuing the tradition to which they pledge allegiance. This seminar will try to establish, with as much accuracy as the subject
allows, what are the central tenets of American Pragmatism, how they have shaped contemporary epistemology and the philosophy of science, and finally, to what extent are
pragmatist approaches to human knowledge philosophically sound and fruitful.
The seminar will fall into two unequal parts. The first, shorter part will focus on the writings of the three classics of American pragmatism—Charles S. Peirce, William James and
John Dewey—and analyze their reaction against traditional epistemology, as well as the positive philosophical ideas that they had to offer. The second, longer part of the seminar

225

will try to isolate and follow some of the pragmatist currents which run through epistemology and philosophy of science in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will read, among
others, selected papers by Carnap, Hempel, Quine, Goodman, Kuhn, Elgin, Hacking, Misak, Putnam, Rorty, and Haack.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class attendance and participation; 6 short assignments (about 2 pages long); class presentation; and 2 longer papers (about 5 pages each).

Along with jazz, pragmatism stands as the greatest uniquely American contribution to world culture. As the music wails in the background, we will study the classic pragmatists:
William James, C. S. Peirce, and John Dewey. We will continue with the contemporary inheritors of the tradition: Cornel West, Richard Rorty, and Hilary Putnam. Although it
has influenced both analytic and continental philosophy, pragmatism is a powerful third philosophical movement. Always asking what practical difference would it make, our
authors investigate the central questions and disputes of philosophy, from epistemology and metaphysics to ethics and religion. Rather than seeing philosophy as an esoteric
discipline, the pragmatic philosophers (with the possible exception of Peirce) see philosophy as integral to our culture and see themselves as public intellectuals.

PHIL 380 Relativism (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
‘Relativism’ is a term often used in philosophy for a great number of very different views. The aim of the course is to survey, analyze and discuss many varieties of relativism—
semantic, epistemic, ontological and moral—from Plato’s Theaetetus to contemporary social constructivism. We will pay special attention to the structure of arguments for and
against relativism, as well as to the moral motivations and perceived consequences of its endorsement or rejection. We will thus be led to discuss some of the concepts common to
epistemology, metaphysics and ethics: reason, justification, objectivity, understanding, reality and truth. Some of the questions we will consider are: Are moral standards relative
to cultural frameworks? Are there incompatible but equally true ways of describing the world? Is rationality—the notion of a good reason to believe something—relative to
cultural norms? Is relativism a form of skepticism? Is it forced on people who endorse cultural pluralism as their political ideal as the only tenable philosophical position?
Our readings will include the relevant works of Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Bayle, Locke, Berkeley, Carnap, Quine, Davidson, Goodman, Elgin, Hacking, Krausz, Foot, Williams,
Harman and Thomson.
Format: seminar. Requirements: This is a writing intensive course. Each student will write 10 weekly short papers (1000 words each); give a class presentation and lead the
ensuing discussion; and write a final paper (7-10 pages). Prerequisites: PHIL 101 and 102, and at least one 200 level PHIL course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 7-10).

PHIL 388T Consciousness (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The nature of consciousness remains a fundamental mystery of the universe. Our internal, felt experience—what chocolate tastes like to oneself, what it is like to see the color red,
or, more broadly, what it is like to have a first person, waking perspective at all—resists explanation in any terms other than the conscious experience itself in spite of centuries of
intense effort by philosophers and, more recently, by scientists. As a result, some prominent researchers propose that the existence of consciousness requires a revision of basic
physics, while others (seemingly desperately) deny that consciousness exists at all. Those positions remain extreme, but the challenge that consciousness poses is dramatic. It is at
the same time the most intimately known fact of our humanity and science’s most elusive puzzle.
In this tutorial we will read the contemporary literature on consciousness. We will concentrate both on making precise the philosophical problem(s) of consciousness and on
understanding the role of the relevant neuroscientific and cognitive research. Tutorial partners will have an opportunity to spend the end of the semester working on a special topic
of their choosing including, for instance, consciousness and freewill, pain and anesthesia, consciousness and artificial intelligence, or disorders of consciousness.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every other week, and will be responsible for commenting on their tutorial
partner’s work on off weeks. Expect several short lectures by the instructor over the course of the semester where all the tutorial members convene.
Prerequisites: PHIL 102 and at least one upper-level course in philosophy. Preference will be given to majors in Philosophy, or concentrators in Neuroscience or Cognitive
Science. Open to sophomores with permission of the instructor. Every effort will be made to pair students according to similar or complimentary background. This course is
writing intensive. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

PHIL 389(S) The Structural-Systematic Philosophy
The structural-systematic philosophy is a theory that, if completed, would qualify as a philosophical theory of everything. Central aspects of this theory are presented in Structure
and Being (by Lorenz Puntel, translated by and in collaboration with Alan White, 2008), Being and God (by Lorenz Puntel, translated by and in collaboration with Alan White,
2011), and Toward a Philosophical Theory of Everything (by Alan White, forthcoming January 2014). Among the topics to be examined, as systematically interconnected, are
language, ontology, knowledge, truth, mind, human freedom, ethics, beauty, Being as such, Being as a whole, and God. For additional information on the structural-systematic
philosophy and on the three books listed above, see www.structureandbeing.com.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, participation, regular short papers and/or presentations, 10- to 15-page term paper.
Prerequisites: any PHIL course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 5-10). Preference to Philosophy majors and potential majors, then by seniority
(seniors, then juniors, then sophomores, then first-years).

PHIL 391T The Ethics of Hume and Kant (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
David Hume and Immanuel Kant are indisputably among the most influential figures in the western philosophical tradition. Interestingly, each regarded his work in epistemology
and metaphysics as a mere prelude to his work in moral philosophy. In both domains, Kant took himself to be responding directly to Hume, whom he credited with awakening
him from his dogmatic slumber. In this tutorial we shall study their core works in moral philosophy, in which they develop conceptions of practical rationality, motivation,
freedom, and morality. For Hume, we’ll read Books II and III of A Treatise of Human Nature, the Second Enquiry, and several essays, including “Of the Standard of Taste.” For
Kant, we’ll read Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and Critique of Practical Reason, along with related essays. Rich and intriguing in their own right, these texts are
particularly rewarding when read together, as they articulate profoundly different views of the nature of human reason, agency, and sociality. It is no exaggeration to say that
Hume and Kant have set the stage for much current work on these issues in contemporary ethics. One happy consequence of the enduring quality of their work is an abundance of
superb secondary literature, which we’ll draw upon to supplement our study of the primary texts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week; each students will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (6 in all)
and comment on their tutorial partner’s paper in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation and oral argument, as well as critical
reasoning and writing.
Prerequisites: A 100-level PHIL course, PHIL 202 (History of Modern Philosophy), or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference: current and
prospective Philosophy majors.

PHIL 393T Nietzsche and His Legacy (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The late 20th Century philosopher Richard Rorty characterized the present age as “post-Nietzschean.” Indeed Nietzsche’s influence has been pervasive. German philosopher
Martin Heidegger thought he represented the culminating point of Western metaphysics; French Nietzscheans such as Foucault, Derrida and Deleuze as well as French feminist
Luce Irigaray appropriate Nietzschean themes and concepts in their critical engagements with the Western philosophical tradition; and Anglo-American moral philosophers such
as Bernard Williams, Alisdair MacIntyre, and Phillippa Foot (as well as Rorty) respond to and engage his critique of traditional morality. In this tutorial we read key writings from
early, middle and late periods by this controversial 19th century philosopher in order to address some (certainly only some) of the current debates in critical and ethical theory that
have been fueled by Nietzsche’s work. Key ideas and concepts such as the death of god, the use and abuse of history, the eternal recurrence, will to power, and master and slave
morality will be addressed. Nietzsche texts will include selections from: Untimely Meditations, The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals, Twilight of the Idols, and Ecce Homo.
Format: tutorial, students will work in pairs. Each student will write and present a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and a commentary on his or her partner’s essay on alternate
weeks. Evaluations are based on written work as well as level of intellectual engagement in tutorial meetings.
Prerequisites: two courses in PHIL, preferably either Ancient and/or Modern surveys, or background in Critical Theory, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference is given to current and prospective Philosophy majors.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Emotions (W)
Philosophy is often described as “thinking about thinking:” variously conceived inquiries into the nature, scope and limits of human reasoning have always been at its heart.
Without challenging the centrality of such projects for philosophy, the seminar will focus on a less emphasized, but equally essential aspect of our lives: emotions. What are
emotions, and how should we think about them? What is the proper “geography”—classification and analysis—of our emotions, and what is their relation to our beliefs, judgments, and evaluations? Which methodological approach—if a single one can be privileged—should we adopt for examining emotions? What is the scope and nature of an
adequate theory of emotions, what are the desiderata for such a theory, and what should count as evidence in its favor? We will examine a variety of philosophical and scientific
theories of emotion, as well as some issues concerning normative aspects of emotions: the role of emotions in a good life, rationality of emotions, moral importance of emotions,
and the concept of emotional maturity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: preparedness for the seminar and participation in seminar discussions; weekly short papers or postings; class presentation; and a final paper, 1015 pages long.
Prerequisites: this course is required of all senior Philosophy majors. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Enrollment is limited to Philosophy majors.

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student’s total educational experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program
develops the mind -body relationship, which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective of the physical education
program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of Physical Education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are five physical education units during the year. In the fall academic
semester, there are two six-week physical education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring academic semester. Two
different activities must be completed.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses offered is issued to every student before each quarter and Winter Study.

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is the wave/particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are
of more than passing interest; some of them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by which the physical world is known
and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics,
applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.

ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy,
and 1 in Mathematics. The core sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics 302, although strongly recommended,
is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in astrophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic requirements for the major. Honors
work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both departments in
determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is given under “Astronomy,” along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered
by that department.

PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Introduction to Mechanics. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for students who either have not had physics before or have had some
physics but are not comfortable solving “word problems” that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Mechanics and Waves. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a
year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore, students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption through the introductory calculus
sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit
of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.

Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall
(typically followed by Physics 210 in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may take either 151 or 142 but not both.
On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the
year by arrangement with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of calculus techniques.

Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin
their studies in Physics 201 are required to take a total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Mechanics and Waves
or Physics 131 Introduction to Mechanics
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics

Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 150 or 151 (formerly 105 or 106) Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent Mathematics 150 or 151 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of courses for the major to ten.

Options
1) Mathematics 140 (formerly 104) may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see “advanced placement” above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the
department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major
requirements. The first-year graduate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics

Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors about course selections or other matters.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out
under the direction of a faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the awarding of the degree with
honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a B average in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program
early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31, and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At
the end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are
required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them
with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.

STUDY ABROAD
The physics community is international in scope and a career in physics (or a related field) can provide many opportunities for travel and contact with individuals from outside
the United States. The physics major at Williams is a carefully structured four-year program designed to prepare students who are so inclined for graduate study at leading
research institutions. While it is possible to complete the major requirements in three years, such a major will not usually not lead to further study in the field. With careful early
planning on the part of a student, and close consultation with the department chair, it is possible to complete a strong major and still study abroad provided the foreign institution
can provide courses which reasonably substitute or supplement those in the Williams major program.

OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics
141 followed by Physics 132, depending on the student’s background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of these sequences satisfies the
physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors.

PHYS 107 Newton, Einstein, and Beyond (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
This course follows a quest to understand the nature of space, time, matter, and energy, one that continues to this day. We will focus on two scientific theories that revolutionized
our understanding of the physical world, Newtonian mechanics (developed in the late 17th century) and Einstein’s special relativity (developed in the early 20th century). As we
explore these theories, we will pay special attention to the very different stories they tell about space and time. We will conclude the semester by touching upon recent develop-

228

ments in cosmology, where observations have led to dramatic surprises about the make-up of our universe, and particle physics, where the Large Hadron Collider experiment is
poised to extend our understanding of nature to higher energies and shorter distances.
This course is intended for students whose primary interests lie outside of the natural sciences and mathematics. The mathematics used will be algebra and trigonometry. Every
student will have three meetings every week. Some weeks the three meetings will be lectures (MWF 10-10:50), other weeks there will be two lectures (MF 10-10:50), and one
conference section.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; problem-solving conference section, one hour per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, two midterms, and a
final exam, all with a significant quantitative component (see the description of the QFR requirement).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 70). Preference given to students based on seniority.
NOTE: every student will have three meetings every week; some weeks the three meetings will be lectures (MWF 10:00-10:50), other weeks there will be two lectures (WF
10:00-10:50) and one conference section.
TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 108(S) Energy Science and Technology (Same as ENVI 108) (Q)
Energy use has skyrocketed in the United States and elsewhere in the world, causing significant economic and political shifts, as well as concerns for the environment. This
course will address the physics and technology of energy generation, consumption, and conservation. It will cover a wide range of energy sources, including fossil fuels, hydropower, solar energy, wind energy, and nuclear energy. We will discuss energy use in transportation, manufacturing, building heating, and building lighting. Students will learn to
compare the efficiencies and environmental impacts of various energy sources and uses.
Format: lecture once a week plus weekly conference section. Evaluation will be based on weekly assignments, two hour tests, and a final project. All of these will be substantially
quantitative.
Prerequisites: high school physics, high school chemistry, and mathematics at the level of MATH 130 (formerly 103). This course will make use of quantitative arguments and an
acquaintance with high school physics and chemistry will prove helpful. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).

STRAIT
PHYS 109 Sound, Light, and Perception (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the details of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human
experience, light and sound have long been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural processing allow us to hear and see
the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch? This course introduces the science and technology of light and sound to students not majoring in physics.
We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color, the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the
physical basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as lasers and optical communications. The class will meet for two 75-minute
periods each week for a variable mixture of lecture, discussion, and hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion. Each student will attend the Thursday lecture plus one conference section weekly. Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets,
in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final exam, all with a quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 55 (expected: 55).
MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Introduction to Mechanics (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton’s laws;
energy and momentum; and gravitation. The physics of rotations and vibrations will also be discussed. We finally turn to the basic properties of waves, such as interference and
refraction, as exemplified with sound and light waves. We also study optics of lenses and mirrors. This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before, or
who have had some physics, but are not comfortable solving “word problems” that require calculus.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on exams, labs, and weekly problem sets, all of which have a substantial
quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 130 (formerly 103); students who scored 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam or on the AP Physics C (mechanics) exam, or 6 or 7 on the IB Physics HL
exam may not take this course and are encouraged to take PHYS 141 instead. Enrollment limit 24 per lab section (expected: 60). PHYS 131 can lead to either PHYS 132 (for
students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or PHYS 142 (for students considering a physics or astrophysics major).

PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the
concept of electric and magnetic fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connection between electric and magnetic
phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday’s Law of Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-century
physics. We will discuss Einstein’s theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of
radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, quizzes and exams, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: PHYS 131 or 141 or permission of instructor, and MATH 130 (formerly 103). Enrollment limit 22 per lab section (expected: 60).

PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
Newtonian Mechanics, spectacular as it is in describing planetary motion and a wide range of other phenomena, only hints at the richness of behaviors seen in the universe.
Special relativity has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies and requires us to rethink our basic notions of space and time. Quantum mechanics
successfully describes atoms, molecules, and solids while at the same time calling into question our notions of what can be predicted by a physical theory. Statistical physics
reveals new behaviors that emerge when many particles are present in a system. This course will survey some of these important ideas, and can serve either as a terminal course
for those seeking to complete a year of physics or can serve as the basis for more advanced study of these topics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week; conference, one hour every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly homework, labs, two
hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: PHYS 141 and MATH 130 (formerly 103), or equivalent; students may not take both PHYS 142 and PHYS 151. PHYS 131 may substitute for PHYS 141 with the
permission of instructor. Enrollment limit 22 per lab section (expected:30).

PHYS 202(S) Vibrations, Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs, water waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and gravitational
waves. Quantum mechanics even describes particles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common characteristics, so that the understanding
of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of
freedom. We then move on to study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave behavior. The rest of the course focuses
on electromagnetic waves and in particular on optical examples of wave phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a
number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics
will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a

This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to
calling attention to certain special equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as looking for series solutions and, in the
case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A series of
optional sessions in Mathematica will be offered for students who are not already familiar with this computational tool.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and several in-class exams, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: MATH 150 (formerly 105) or MATH 151 (formerly 106) and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of PHYS 131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR

STRAUCH

PHYS 231T Facts of Life (Not offered 2013-2014) (Q)
The cancer death rate scales like (age)6 so it was thought that a proliferating cancer cell must have acquired 6 mutations. The probability of having had N sexual partners scales
like N-2.4. Body Mass Index = Mass / Length2. The heart rate is proportional to the organism’s mass0.75. The number of policemen scales like population1.15. Power-law relationships often describe emergent phenomena of self-organizing systems. In this course we will learn how to obtain data and plot it in an informative way, including estimates of the
errors of fits. We will learn how to describe phenomena with differential equations and to find analytic and numerical solutions. With those tools we will study the human
experience: births, body size, sex, death rates (by cause, by age, by gender), metrics of cities, distributions of common names, population growth rates, per capita use of energy,
the spread of disease, etc. Projects will involve applying the methods to new phenomena.
Format: tutorial, plus one lecture per week. Requirements: weekly problem sets, projects.
Prerequisites: MATH 150 (formerly 105). Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to maturity, curiosity, diversity.

PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one–semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of
the quantum theory, and the Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave–packets are introduced.
Solutions to one–dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the three–dimensional
hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical predictions of the
quantum theory and introduce the Heisenberg formalism. We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics
concentrating on applications involving angular momentum and spins.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have

POLITICAL ECONOMY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LARA SHORE-SHEPPARD
Advisory Committee: Professors: BAKIJA, CRANE, MAHON, MONTIEL, SHORE-SHEPPARD. Associate Professors: LALUMIA, MELLOW, PAUL.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and economic forces interact in shaping public policy. The major includes
substantial study of the central analytical approaches in both Political Science and Economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artificial barriers of specialization that may
characterize either discipline taken by itself. Three of the required Political Economy courses undertake a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields. These courses
are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and economists. Political Economy 250 examines major theoretical texts in political economy and analyzes
economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines contemporary issues in political economy in
their domestic, comparative and international contexts. Political Economy 402 asks students to research and make proposals in policy areas of current importance. Background
for the two senior courses is acquired through courses in international, domestic and comparative economics, politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political
Economy 402 group projects. This is a course requirement and thus a requirement for the major.

MAJOR
The Political Economy major requires students to complete eleven (11) courses: four introductory courses in both Economics and Political Science; four courses specific to the
Political Economy Program; and three electives. In order to balance students’ educations, majors may not take all three of their electives in the same department or academic
discipline. In light of the public policy orientation of the program, all majors are also required to complete one course with a substantial experiential education component which
is related to the making or effect of public policy. This can be fulfilled through a regular semester-length course (which might also serve as an elective in the major), a study
abroad academic internship, a winter study course or internship, or a summer internship.

Credit for Coursework Done Elsewhere
The four Political Economy Program courses must be completed at Williams without exception. The three electives and the introductory courses in Political Science may be
completed during a study abroad. The general policy of the Program is to grant credit for one course per semester abroad and in extraordinary circumstances, credit for three courses
for an entire year abroad. Students who score a 5 on the AP exam in Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, U.S. Government and Politics and/or Comparative Government and
Politics may receive credit for the cognate introductory course(s) in the major. Credit for A levels and IB exams in economics is given consistent with the current policy of the
Economics Department. No substitute higher-level coursework is required for majors receiving credit in this way, although it is certainly encouraged.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political
Economy 493-W31) during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normally be an elective in Political Science
or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair
by the end of the first week after spring vacation. Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair’s office and on the program website. The proposal should have
been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each discipline must be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in late May after spring grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee
consisting of the two advisors and a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest honors.

STUDY ABROAD
Despite the fact that Political Economy requires more courses than the typical major, many Political Economy majors go abroad. Since POEC 250 and POEC 253 are offered
in the fall, students considering spending only one semester abroad often find spring to be the better choice. Nonetheless, many students study away for the fall or the whole year.
Political Economy majors have often been overrepresented in Williams at Oxford. Students planning to be abroad in the fall should take POEC 250 in their sophomore year if at
all possible. Similarly, planning ahead to find the best way to satisfy the empirical methods requirement before the fall of the senior year is strongly encouraged. The easiest major
credits to obtain abroad are the electives in political science and economics.
POEC 250(F) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as ECON 299 and PSCI 238)
Economic liberalism holds that society is better off if people enjoy economic freedom. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it wrongly assumes, and
hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential works of political economy. Its first part
examines major thinkers in relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx’s
revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill and John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liberalism
from a variety of perspectives. and then illustrates the contending perspectives with reference to important policy areas. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves frequent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: ECON 110 and 120 or equivalent; PSCI 201 or 203 (may be taken concurrently with POEC 250) or a score of 5 on the AP exam in U.S. Government and Politics;
(or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 30). Preference given to Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.

POEC 253(F) Empirical Methods in Political Economy (Q)
This course introduces students to common empirical tools used in policy analysis and implementation. The broad aim is to train students to be discriminating consumers of
public policy-relevant research. The emphasis in the course is on intuitive understanding of the central concepts. Through hands-on work with data and critical assessment of
existing empirical social scientific research, students will develop the ability to choose and employ the appropriate tool for a particular research problem, and to understand the
limitations of the techniques. Topics to be covered include basic principles of probability; random variables and distributions; statistical estimation, inference and hypothesis
testing; and modeling using multiple regression, with a particular focus on understanding whether and how relationships between variables can be determined to be causal-an
essential requirement for effective policy formation. Throughout the course, the focus will be on public policy applications relevant to the fields of political science, sociology,
and public health, as well as to economics.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: problem sets, group projects, and three exams.
Prerequisites: MATH 130 (formerly 103) or its equivalent and one course in ECON; not open to students who have taken ECON 255. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).

POEC 401(F) Contemporary Problems in Political Economy
This course examines contemporary problems in political economy at and across diverse spatial scales. Using both Economics and Political Science methods of analysis, students study the exercise of power and the accumulation of wealth in the world today as well as central public policy debates around those processes. We begin with a discussion
of the philosophical foundations of economic policymaking. Then we move through three course sections organized around contemporary problems at three distinct scales: the
United States political economy, comparative political economy with an emphasis on the advanced capitalist countries, and the global political economy. We end by taking issues
usually studied at a single scale and exploring their interconnections through an integrated political-economic and public policy analysis of immigration. The goal of this course is
both to build upon theoretical debates encountered in POEC 250 as well as to prepare students for the public policy analysis they will do in POEC 402.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two 8- to 10-page papers; one 12- to 15-page paper rewrite; three short data analysis projects; in-class group presentations; class participation.
Prerequisites: ECON 110 and 120; PSCI 201 or 203, or equivalent; PSCI 202 or 204, or equivalent; open to non-majors. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 22). Preference given to

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to craft a common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a
way to reconcile conflicts of interest among their members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine its just uses. Power may be used
wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be wished away. Political science attends to the ways that social power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or
justified. The contests over power and the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and pathos. The effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and
explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of studying politics or to develop their own focus. To this end, the
department offers two routes to completing the major, each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the subfields that structure the
discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics), or to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests, regardless of subfields.

MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield: American politics, international relations, political theory, or comparative
politics. The subfield concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from 201-204, two electives of the student’s
choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student’s subfield. Students selecting political theory as their subfield concentration must take
Political Science 231 or Political Science 232 as one of their four subfield courses, in addition to taking Political Science 203 and prior to taking Political Science 430. With
permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different subfield, providing they take a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition,
students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth requirement (all methods courses also count toward the breadth requirement). The faculty advisor must approve the student plan. All students must take at least one 300-level course and one research course to complete the major. (Most senior
seminars are also research courses but, especially in political theory, not all are.) In addition, no more than two 100-level courses can count toward the major.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also requires nine (9) courses, with at
least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a
senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To
complete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must
approve the student plan. All students must take at least one 300-level course and one research course to complete the major. (Most senior seminars are also research courses but,
especially in political theory, not all are.) In addition, no more than two 100-level courses can count toward the major.

ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or she may register with any Political Science faculty member. The
registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided students in finding an advisor. In all cases, students will be paired at
the beginning of junior year with an advisor who will continue with them through graduation.

COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of a course The 100-level courses are designed to address political
topics from multiple subfield perspectives; many are seminars designed for first-year students. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The
core courses, numbered from 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The introductory subfield course
must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level elective courses delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-level courses have no
prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and have prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for students in the major; senior seminars also are open
to juniors and to non-majors if space permits. In general, the main subfield of non-core courses can be read from the middle digit of the course number: 0 or 1 for American
politics; 2 or 6 for international relations; 3 or 7 for political theory; 4 or 5 for comparative politics; and 8 for non-subfield electives.

WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the student’s understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and
students without previous WSP 99 experience have preference.

THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study off-campus. Generally, only one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the
College may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.

PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE STUDY
The Department recommends that students contemplating graduate school, especially if they plan to study fields outside political theory, take a course in research and quantitative methods, such as PSCI 300 or, if it is not taught, ECON/POEC 253.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year, (2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department’s
honors committee and for which an appropriate advisor is available, (3) have a record of academic excellence in Political Science. The last includes not only the
student’s cumulative GPA in Political Science, generally 3.5 or above, but also demonstrated research and writing skills, evidenced by one or two examples of graded
work submitted along with the thesis proposal. Along with the successful completion of a high-quality thesis, the degree with honors in Political Science requires
enrollment in the year-long senior thesis seminar, in addition to the other nine (9) courses of the regular major requirements.

ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage in an entire year’s advanced research in American politics under
singularly favorable conditions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic Scholar (after the name of the
fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W33-482) is designed to encourage the pursuit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political
Science. Admission to it is awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and of the project’s promise for creative
contributions to the understanding of American politics, political institutions and thought.

This course will explore both the historical background and current dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political
science or Asian studies is necessary.

PSCI 110 Seminar: The Politics of Place in America (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
What does it mean when someone says they’re a Midwesterner? A New Englander? A Texan? Is there importance attached to being an urban resident versus a suburbanite?
What about a rural resident? What’s the significance of living in a border town? This course explores the politics of place. The country’s politics have always been keyed, in
important ways, to geography: representation in national government is defined in terms of geographic areas; resources from the national government are distributed unequally
around the country; state and local governments, which have an influential role in our political system, vary tremendously from one place to the next; and the country’s history has
been marked by the violence of geographic conflicts as well as the acquisition of new territory. Much of its social and economic life can also be understood in terms of geography.
Patterns of settlement, immigration, slavery, agriculture, education, religion, and cultural production have left and continue to leave different patterns of sediment throughout the
country; these patterns and their interactions form the bedrock of American politics. We will spend the semester thinking about the significance of place in politics by exploring
the ways that culture, economy, and political institutions vary throughout the country. Topics covered will include urbanization and urban politics, the development of the suburbs, regional differences, and the effects of globalization on local differences.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly 1-page reading responses, two 5-page papers, one 15-page research paper.

PSCI 120(S) America and the World (Same as INST 101 and LEAD 120)
The basic question animating this course is quite simple. What’s the deal with American foreign policy? This question is posed not from any normative viewpoint, but rather from
a historical one: viewed from the past, contemporary American foreign policy seems bizarre.
A country founded on (with a couple of exceptions) three centuries of political isolation outside of the Western hemisphere now bestrides the globe like a colossus. During the age

234

of empire at the turn of the century, when Europeans controlled vast swathes of Africa and Asia, America conquered the Philippine Islands. By accident, more or less. During the
first part of the great global struggle known as the Cold War, American statesmen looked longingly at the exits from Europe. Historically, Americans don’t do foreign policy. But
the world has changed, and perhaps America has as well. President Roosevelt’s prophecy during the Second World War has come true: “there is literally no question, political or
military, in which the United States is not interested.”
The object of this course is to introduce you to international relations and American foreign policy through a study of the problems and dynamics of America’s new situation.
Several general themes emerge over the semester. What are the major forces driving American foreign policy; that is, what causes change and continuity in the American
approach? How have American statesmen thought about these issues? What are the dynamics of particular foreign policy problems? And, most importantly, what policies should
the United States pursue? To get a handle on these issues we will study American foreign policy traditions, American strategy during and after the Cold War, terrorism, the
contemporary Middle East, and other topics of current interest.

PSCI 201(F,S) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneously praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by
others and remodeled itself. This course introduces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order and that have nurtured these conflicting
assessments. Topics include the founding of the American system and the primary documents (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), the
primary institutions of national government then and now (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court), the role of race in American politics, and the politics of policymaking in the United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary factors that have shaped American political development. In investigating these topics, we
explore questions such as these: How is power allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and effective governance?
How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce good policies, and how do we define what is good?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: depending on the section, some combination of response papers, short-to-medium papers, exams, and class participation

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
Whereas the field of comparative politics looks at what goes on inside various countries, international relations considers the actions of sovereign states toward one another and
the patterns and institutions that they create. International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy characterizes the
world of sovereign states—there is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among
countries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the
same topics that consume domestic politics—ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration—it shares few of the same processes for dealing with them. This course covers the theories and problems central to international relations. It considers the importance that
this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: some combination of short papers, midterm exam/paper, final exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites; this is an introductory course, open to first-year students and sophomores. Juniors and seniors may enroll only with permission of instructor, and only under

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
Is politics war by other means? Is it merely a practical way to meet our needs? Or is it, rather, the activity through which citizens pursue justice and the good life? And what is
justice? How can it be established and secured? What are the powers and obligations of citizenship? Who should rule? Who decides? On what basis? Political theory addresses
questions such as these as it investigates the fundamental problems of how we can, do, and ought to live together. The questions have sparked controversy since the origins of
political thinking; the answers remain controversial now. This course addresses the controversies, focusing on major works of ancient, modern, and contemporary theory by such
authors as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault. Themes may include authority, obligation, power, war,
violence, freedom, justice, equality, democracy, liberalism, capitalism, community, and pluralism, though the emphasis will vary from semester to semester.

PSCI 204(F,S) Introduction to Comparative Politics: State, Nation, and Democracy
While the field of international relations focuses on the actions of sovereign states towards one another, the comparative study of politics looks mainly at what goes on inside
countries, the domestic dynamics of political power and institutions. It asks, for example, where sovereign states come from, why political life differs so much from one country
to another, and how political regimes, structures and institutions change, sometimes suddenly. Thus comparative politics is often about what citizens of countries with stable and
relatively effective governments take for granted (and why they may take it for granted).
In this course, we will examine several broad historical-political themes: the rise of modern state structures; the emergence of capitalism; the articulation of national identities; the
spread of liberalism and democracy; and the roots of terrorism, and the effects of war and religion on politics. Worthwhile answers will require us to look at them theoretically,
historically, comparatively, and through contemporary developments.

SWIFT
PSCI 206T Dangerous Leadership in American Politics (Same as LEAD 206T) (Not offered 2013-2014)(W)
Leadership in American politics today is typically celebrated. A common assumption is that those who do it well-whether in the presidency, the parties, social movements,
organizations, or local communities-are just and legitimate agents of democratic change, and those most celebrated are those who have helped the country make progress toward
its ideals. Yet to rest on this is too simple as it is, in part, an artifact of historical construction. Assessing leadership in the moment is complicated because leaders press against the
bounds of political convention-as do ideologues, malcontents, and lunatics. Indeed, a central concern of the founders was that democracy would invite demagogues who would
bring the nation to ruin. Complicating things further, the nature of democratic competition is such that those vying for power have incentive to portray the opposition’s leadership
as dangerous. How do we distinguish desirable leadership from dangerous leadership? Can they be the same thing? Many who today are recognized as great leaders were, in their
historical moment, branded dangerous. Others, whose ambitions and initiatives arguably undermined progress toward American ideals, were not recognized as dangerous at the
time. In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of dangerous leadership in American history, from inside as well as outside of government. What constitutes dangerous leadership, and what makes a leader dangerous? Is it the person or the context? Who decides? How do we distinguish truly dangerous leadership from the perception of dangerous
leadership? Does dangerous describe the means or the ends of leadership? Does it matter? Is leadership that privileges desirable ends, such as justice or security, at the expense of
democratic means acceptable? Is democratic leadership in service of “dangerous” goals acceptable, and what are these goals?

PSCI 207 Political Elections (Not offered 2013-2014)
The National and state elections taking place this fall, 2010, will be “interesting”. Historically, mid-term elections, elections without the dominant consideration of who will be
the President, generate less attention and less involvement of the public. But, while midterm elections often seem to have less at stake, in 2010 much is at stake. The 21st century
in the United States has had a very turbulent beginning and the American public is very divided over how best to respond to the many challenges that confront the United States.
This course explores the factors that shape the outcome of political elections in America. Among the factors we will consider are the state of the economy, international events,
the role of political parties at the state and national levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the “hot” issues of the moment, of
which there are many, and long enduring issues that have long generated conflict at the national level. We will consider in detail the 2010 national mid-term elections both for
Federal office (Senate and House) and for state offices (governors and state legislators).

PSCI 208T Wealth in America (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
The pursuit of wealth is an important feature of American political identity, captured by the ideas of the American dream and the Protestant work ethic. The accumulation of
wealth has been lauded as both a worthy individual activity and a vital component of the nation’s public interest. Yet inequality in wealth may conflict with the political equality
necessary for democratic governance and public trust, leading to concerns that we are sacrificing community, fairness, and opportunity for the benefit of a small portion of the
population. This tutorial focuses on questions about the public value of wealth and its accumulation, which have become more pressing now that the richest one percent of
Americans own 34 percent of privately held wealth. Some readings will be historical, particularly those focusing on American political thought and the politics of the Gilded
Age, such as Andrew Carnegie’s “Gospel of Wealth”. Most of the readings, such as Graetz and Shapiro’s Death by a Thousand Cuts and Pierson and Hacker’s Winner-Take-All
Politics, will focus on contemporary political debates about the accumulation, concentration, and redistribution of wealth, prompted by concerns about high—and increasing—
inequality in both income and wealth.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: five essays (5 pages each), five critiques (2 pages each), and one final paper.

poverty, and how do Americans perceive its danger to individuals as well as political community? What economic, historical, and sociological theories have been advanced to
explain poverty? Why has the U.S. adopted some approaches to reduce poverty but not others? What enduring political conflicts have shaped the U.S. welfare state?

PSCI 211(S) Public Opinion and Political Behavior (Q)
The focus of this course is the role of public opinion in democratic regimes. The influence of public opinion on public affairs and popular governments is a relatively new
phenomenon in the history of governments (largely subsequent to the American and French revolutions). We can see from recent events the impact of public opinion: In the early
1990s the American public quickly became interested in drought and starvation in Somalia pressing the American government to intervene, if briefly and unsuccessfully. Some
have claimed that American journalists successfully provoked the American public to go to war (the Spanish-American War, creating the slogan, “Remember the Maine”), and
to withdraw from war (Viet Nam). More recently, public support to commence the Iraq war was generated in the United States while at the same time democratic publics in other
nations strongly opposed the war. We see political leaders make use of the“bully pulpit” to rally support for their agendas, efforts that sometimes succeed and other times fail. We
shall explore public opinion in American politics. There are many interesting questions awaiting us this semester. How do events and crises influence public opinion? Which
psychological, sociological, and political factors impact public opinion formation? When and under what circumstances do pressure groups influence public opinion? Do mass
beliefs alter individual voters’ choices? When and how do political leaders influence public opinion and when does public opinion influence political leaders?
Format: lecture/discussion. In addition, we will have direct access to the holdings of the Roper Center, using iPOLL, which enables direct exploration of the thousands of polls on
American public opinion from 1937 to today. Requirements: 8- to 12-page research paper, a midterm and final examination.

Historically, African Americans have been treated as group members rather than as individuals by mainstream society; consequently, a very unique set of political attitudes and
behaviors have developed among Blacks in the United States. This course explores the political history of African Americans as well as the relationship between African Americans and the American political system. Political elites as well as individual citizens and grassroots movements have influenced Black politics. In turn, we will focus on how
national, state, and local governments have affected African American communities through the implementation of policies-some of which have been discriminatory while
others have been aimed to ameliorate racial disparities. We will also analyze how Black Americans have responded through the political system. Since this course (nor any
course) has the capacity to explore the vast history of Black politics, we will focus primarily on contemporary, African American politics between 1960 and the Obama era. Class
time will be divided between lectures and class discussions.

PSCI 216(F) American Constitutionalism I: Structures of Power
How has the American Constitution been debated and understood over time? What is the relationship between constitutional and political change? This course examines the
historical development of American constitutional law and politics from the Founding to the present. Our focus is on structures of power—the limits on congressional lawmaking, growth of presidential authority, establishment of judicial review, conflicts among the three branches of the federal government, and boundaries between the federal and state
and local governments. The specific disputes under these rubrics range from secession to impeachment, gun control to child labor, waging war to spurring commerce; the
historical periods to be covered include the Marshall and Taney Court years, the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Progressive Era, the New Deal, the Warren Court, and the
conservative ascendancy of the late twentieth century. Readings are drawn from Supreme Court opinions, presidential addresses, congressional debates and statutes, political
party platforms, key tracts of American political thought, and secondary scholarship on constitutional development. Throughout the semester, our goal will be less to remember
elaborate doctrinal rules and multi-part constitutional “tests” than to understand the changing nature of, and changing relationship between, constitutional power and constitutional meaning in American history.

The specific disputes under these rubrics range from abortion to affirmative action, hate speech to capital punishment, school prayer to same-sex marriage; the historical periods to be covered include the early republic, the ante-bellum era, the Civil War and Reconstruction, World Wars I and

To study the presidency is to study human nature and personality, constitution and institution, strategy and contingency. This course will examine the problems and paradoxes
that attend the exercise of the most powerful political office in the world’s oldest democracy: Can an executive office be constructed with sufficient energy to govern and also be
democratically accountable? How much do we attribute the shaping of politics to the agency of the individual in the office and to what extent are politics the result of structural,
cultural, and institutional factors? Are the politics of the presidency different in foreign and domestic policy? How are national security concerns balanced with domestic priorities such as the protection of civil liberties? How is the office and purpose of the presidency affected by an economic order predicated on private capital? Exploration of these
questions will lead us to examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership issues, congressional-executive relations, the
media, and emergency powers. Attention will focus largely on the modern presidency, though older historical examples will also be used to help us gain perspective on these
problems.

PSCI 223(S) International Law
International law embodies the rules that govern the society of states. It spells out who can be a state and how to become one, what states can do, what they cannot do, and who
can punish transgressions; it also determines the status of other actors, like international organizations, heads of state, refugees, transnational religious institutions and multinational corporations. International law is like domestic law, with one difference: the same group that makes the law enforces it. In other respects it is the same: it protects the status
quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegitimate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful; it tells
its members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is laughable and purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like
domestic law, it is enforced only some of the time, and then against the weak more than the strong. Yet law is still where we look first for justice, and sometimes even for order.
This course will examine the historical bases of contemporary international law, its development since World War II in the context of the Holocaust and decolonization, and
current dilemmas and ambiguities in its practice. Students will study primary materials (treaties, orders, memos and cases). This is not a law-school course, but an academic
course in the liberal arts.

We live in the era of neo-liberalism. But what does this mean? This course will focus on neo-liberalism in comparative perspective, looking mainly at the US and Europe. It will
consider how neo-liberalism is defined, the role of states in making and maintaining neo-liberalism, the centrality of markets to neo-liberal conceptions, and the kinds of politics
that produced and are produced by neo-liberalism. Economically, the course will look at the institutional configuration of neo-liberalism, changes in economies, growing inequality, the financial crises, and prevalence of debt. Politically, the course will address changes in the role of government, what governments do and do not do, the growing influence
of financial interests, the role of identities in mobilizing support for and legitimating governments, and the impact of these developments on the status of citizenship and democracy.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three papers, one 3-page, one 5-page, and one 10-page paper.

PSCI 225 International Security (Not offered 2013-2014)
This class is about the means, methods, and motives for violence in international politics. We will study the causes of war; the effectiveness of forces on the battlefield; and the
implications of both for contemporary problems in American foreign policy. In so doing, we will analyze some of the major theories of international relations, review the historical events that gave birth to the modern world, and gain a basic understanding of the nuts and bolts of military forces.
The course has very little international economics in it and even less about international organizations. It focuses on states and therefore mostly ignores non-state and transnational actors, neither terrorists nor Doctors without Borders make an appearance. Sunshine, roses, and happy thoughts are not present in great abundance. This is the seedier side of
international politics: the behavior of Great Powers, yesterday and today. Why take such a course?
The impulse to drawback from the brutality of war is humane, and in the present era of relative peace and prosperity, natural. But the subject matter could not be more important,
despite its dark nature. Discovering the causes of past wars, the present peace, and the dynamics of state behavior throughout history will provide vital clues to navigating the
problems of today and tomorrow. After a similar period of peace during the nineteenth century, people could and did write that the problem of war was behind us. Things worked
out rather differently. It will pay massive dividends to get our predictions right for the coming century, and this class will help you think about how to make them.

PSCI 230 American Political Thought (Not offered 2013-2014)
What makes political thought “American”? Is there something distinct about the American political imagination that shapes how we think about liberty, equality, and government? And who exactly is the “we”? This course examines these questions and others by exploring the evolving relationship between conceptions of “the frontier” and the idea of
representation throughout American history. We shall see that debates over how to represent the community lead almost inescapably to the question of the proper boundary of the
community - of who gets included or excluded from membership in the polity. We will explore the Founding period in detail, and then move on to examine several expansions of
the public sphere in the 19th and 20th centuries, including those related to race, gender, class, and nationality. How do these openings in the political realm reflect differing notions
of freedom, justice, and property? In conclusion we will ask how the meaning of “America” may be affected by recent debates over immigration and “la frontera” to the south.

PSCI 231(F) Ancient Political Thought (Same as PHIL 231)
The core activity of this seminar is the careful reading and sustained discussion of selected works by Plato and Aristotle, but we will also engage such other thinkers as Epictetus
and Augustine, and, from a political and theoretical point of view, selections from the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. Among the questions that we will address: What is
justice? How can it be known and pursued? How is political power generated and exercised? What are the social and ethical prerequisites—and consequences—of democracy?
Must the freedom or fulfillment of some people require the subordination of others? Does freedom require leading (or avoiding) a political life? What distinguishes that kind of
life from others? What does it mean to be “philosophical” or to think “theoretically” about politics? Although we will attempt to engage the readings on their own terms, we will
also ask how the vast differences between the ancient world and our own undercut or enhance the texts’ ability to illuminate the dilemmas of political life for us.

PSCI 232(S) Modern Political Thought (Same as PHIL 232)
This course invites you to contemplate some of the core questions taken up by major political thinkers from the 16th through the 20th century, through close readings of a number
of pivotal texts. Beginning with the revival of classical republicanism during the Renaissance and the advent of new scientific outlooks on politics in the early modern period, we
will proceed to key texts in the liberal and social-contract traditions, Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment republican thought, liberal Utilitarian perspectives, classical
Marxism, and finally to the work of Hannah Arendt, one of the most significant interpreters and critics of modern political theory in the 20th century. The thinkers we will read in
this course include Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Karl
Marx, and Arendt. These thinkers have much to tell us about the political ideals and concerns that seemed exciting or pressing in the past. But their texts may also reorient and
energize our thinking about politics today. Read with an open mind and a critical spirit, they can challenge our settled preconceptions about good and evil, provoke reexamination
of our role as citizens, demand that we justify our institutions afresh, and even inspire us to describe a better, more just future. Through classroom dialogue and personal reflection, we will carefully ponder partial answers to immense, enduring questions: What is justice? What is freedom? Who should rule? With what limits and justifications? What
form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? And on what grounds can we justify confidence in our answers to such questions?

Conservative thinkers claim to be leading an intellectual transformation away from the tired nostrums of liberalism. They see themselves as original, dynamic, serious. This
course will read leading conservative political thinkers with a view to identifying their central tenets, both negative and positive. What is it that they oppose and what is it that they
support? What, if anything, defines contemporary conservative thinking? Is it a coherent body of thought, a doctrine, or a collection of disparate and conflicting thinkers? What is
the relationship of thinkers who emphasize the market, order, and traditional values?

PSCI 236 Sex, Gender, and Political Theory (Same as WGSS 236) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course offers a feminist reading of some of the most important concepts and theoretical concerns in the study of politics: freedom, justice, equality, obligation, alienation and
objectification. Each of these terms will be evaluated from the perspective of its potential to address social inequities of sex, gender, race and class. Is welfare a problem for
freedom theory? In what way might a pregnancy be experienced as a form of alienation, and how does this pose a challenge for theories of justice? Is it possible to treat another
person as equal and at the same time an object of one’s sexual desire? We will identify the analytical tools and strategies that feminist theorists have employed in order to bring
these and other concerns into political theory scholarship, reconstructing traditional ideas of politics and public life in the process. Theorists whose work we will read include
Susan Moller Okin, Nancy Hirschmann, Martha Nussbaum, Iris Marion Young, Drucilla Cornell, Gayatri Spivak, Dorothy Roberts, Judith Butler, Linda Zerilli and Catherine
Mackinnon.

PSCI 239 Science, Gender and Power (Same as WGSS 238) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course considers debates in feminism about the relationship between science, gender and power in politics. On the one hand, shifting ideas about gender have influenced the
development of the sciences through history: for example, some feminists argue that science has historically been premised upon a view of women as objects, not subjects, of
knowledge. On the other hand, shifting ideas about science have strongly influenced the development of feminist theory and practice: for example, debates about reproductive
rights are often couched in terms of a conflict between reliable scientific knowledge of embryos, STDs, etc. and an unscientific, patriarchal worldview. Do science and technology serve to transform or reinforce power imbalances based on gender, race, and sexuality? Should feminist theory embrace objectivity and model itself upon scientific procedures
of knowledge production? Or should feminists reject objectivity as a myth told by the powerful about their own knowledge-claims and develop an alternative approach to
knowledge? What is “objectivity” anyway, and how has this norm changed through history? What kinds of alternatives to objectivity exist, and should they, too, count as “science”? Rather than treating science as a monolith, we will endeavor to understand the implications of various sciences--as practiced and envisioned in various, historically
specific situations--for gender and politics. Readings may include texts by Rene Descartes, Andreas Vesalius, Londa Schiebinger, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Helen Longino, Nancy
Harstock, Sandra Harding, bell hooks, Donna Haraway, Mary Hawkesworth, and Octavia Butler.

PSCI 240(S) (formerly 250) Theories of Comparative Politics
This course will deal with the debate between Karl Marx and Max Weber that organizes much of the contemporary study of comparative politics. The course is divided into four
sections. First, it begins with a close reading of Marx and Weber and a comparison of their modes of political analysis. It will engage the debate between them about the source
and nature of power. What is it, and where does it come from? Is it primarily “material” in content or largely “ideal”? What does each think about the origins of capitalism, and

238

what is at stake theoretically in their respective interpretations? Second, the course will consider how Marx and Weber have influenced 20th century thinking about the relationship between capitalism and modernity. Is modernity intimately linked with capitalism, as Marx would argue, or is it separate from it, as Weber would have it? To get at this
question, we will read Karl Polanyi and Barrington Moore in this section. Third, the course will address Marxist and Weberian treatments of states. What are they? Where do
states come from? Do they originate in consent? In war? Are they autonomous from or captured by social forces? In this section, we will read Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol,
Alfred Stephan, and Karl Schmitter. Finally, the course will consider what comparative politics has to say about the nature and origins of collective political identities (national,
ethnic, cultural). What are they and where do they come from? Are they artifacts of the economy, as Marxists suggest, or do they come from states and religions, as Weber has it?

image of African politics as universally and inexplicably lawless, violent, and anarchic. This course begins by examining the nature and legacies of colonial rule and nationalist
movements. From there, we consider the African state, highlighting the factors that have made some states weak and others strong. The course then turns to how ethnicity, class
and civil society operate as bases of political mobilization. Finally, the course analyzes the causes, consequences and limitations of the recent waves of political and economic
liberalization across Africa.

PSCI 247 Political Power in Contemporary China (Not offered 2013-2014)
The People’s Republic of China presents us with two grand political narratives: socialism and democracy. In the Maoist era, a distinctive understanding of socialism, which
claimed to be a more genuine democracy, brought hope and, ultimately, tragedy to hundreds of millions of people. In the post-Mao era, Chinese politics has been driven by the
need to redefine socialism in the wake of the world-historic calamities of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and, more recently, the end of the Cold War. The
state cannot simply give up the socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist Party hegemony evaporates. But China’s rulers cannot avoid political reform, both
ideological and institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis born of Maoist failures. Within this context has emerged the contemporary Chinese democracy
movement which, in all of its complexity, looks to both socialist discourse and Western practice to create a new politics that checks tyrannical abuses of state power and engenders a civil society. What is Chinese democracy now? What are its prospects and what is its relationship to the ideas of socialism?

Since its founding, the United States has had to balance the American creed of equality for all, on one hand, with racial inequality, on the other hand. Is this challenge something
exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to compare and contrast how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how
race and politics interact in various countries. We will examine the phenomena of race and ethnicity in the political development of several countries including the U.S., South
Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. We will ask: What is the difference between race and ethnicity? What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial
ideologies and racial hierarchies? Is there such thing as a racial democracy? Is there a difference between the U.S’s “race problem,” Latin America’s “shade problem” and
Europe’s “immigrant problem”? By the end of the class, students will have a broad knowledge of the similarities and differences of racial and ethnic issues across the globe. Class

areas of the world, such as Cuba and Vietnam? Finally, could the Cold War have been ended long before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989? Political scientists and
historians continue to argue vigorously about the answers to all these questions. We examine both traditional and revisionist explanations of the Cold War, as well as the new
findings that have emerged from the partial opening of Soviet and Eastern European archives. The final section of the course examines how scholarly interpretations of the Cold
War continue to influence how policymakers approach contemporary issues in American foreign policy.

Every American president from Franklin Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy sought to avoid a commitment of ground forces to Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson also feared the consequences of a massive American commitment, but he eventually sent over half a million men to Vietnam. Richard Nixon hoped to conclude a peace with honor when he assumed
the presidency, but the war lasted for another four years with many additional casualties. This course examines the complex political processes that led successive American
presidents to get involved in a conflict that all of them desperately wanted to avoid. We will examine both the international and domestic context of the war, as well as pay close
attention to both South and North Vietnamese perspectives on the war. In addition, we will examine the long-standing arguments among both historians and political scientists

enormous number of people. Tourism accounts for most of the revenue that the poorest countries receive; meanwhile, presidents and prime ministers of nuclear-capable countries
beg on TV for visitors. Where are the politics in this vast, complicated industry and why is no one paying attention? This class explores various types of tourism, asking what

239

happens in a tourist encounter, who benefits, who loses, and what changes. We will examine cases—Antigua vs. Auschwitz, Angkor Wat vs. Alaska—to help us understand the
process from the points of view of the tourists, the toured-upon, and the governments and international organizations that oversee this industry. Our readings range from academic
anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology (MacCannell, Veblen) to magazine accounts (Kincaid, Krakauer).

international relations. We will engage some of the central questions and issues in the current debate on East Asia. Do East Asian countries seek for security and prosperity in a
way fundamentally different from the Western system? Is there a single best way to maintain regional order and cooperation across regions? Will a strong China inevitably claim
its traditional place under the Sun? Will Japan continue to live as a nation with enormous economic power but no military means? What is the choice for South Korea between
security alliance with the United States and national reconciliation with the North? Will North Korea survive? What should be done to dissuade the totalitarian regime in North
Korea from acquiring nuclear capabilities and lead it to different paths toward national survival? By the end of the semester, you will gain both a general perspective and substantive knowledge on East Asia.

from the early Spanish American independence movements through the end of the Cold War, with some emphasis on the latter. We consider how this history confirms or
undermines influential views about US foreign relations and about international relations generally. We also compare historical US foreign policy toward the hemisphere to
current policy globally.

PSCI 273 (formerly 400) Politics Without Humans, Humans without Politics (Same as ENVI 273) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Are human beings the only beings who belong in politics? And is political involvement a unique or defining aspect of what it means to be human? Such questions are increasingly complex as the boundaries of “the human” become blurred by the rise of artificial intelligence, robotics, and brain implants: shifting attitudes towards both animal and human
bodies; and the automation of economic and military decisions (buy! sell! attack! retreat!) that used to be the prerogative of human actors. How do visions of politics without
humans and humans without politics impact our thinking about longstanding questions of freedom, power, and right? Can and should the link between humans and politics
survive in an age in which “posthuman” or “transhuman” entities become central characters in the drama of politics? This class will consider these questions through readings,
films and artifacts that bring political theory into conversation with science fiction, popular literature on the so-called “singularity” (the merger of humans with computers),
science and technology studies, evolutionary anthropology, “new materialist” philosophy, and feminist theory.

‘Ronald Reagan’s pronouncement in 1981 that “government is not a solution to our problem, government is the problem” defined American politics for nearly three decades.
Skepticism of government has deep roots and strong resonance throughout American political history, yet in many ways the American state has grown steadily larger and
stronger. This course explores this conundrum by examining the American state, and its growth, in various arenas. We will assess traditional theories about the weak American
state in light of arguments about the state as: regulator of family and “private” life, adjudicator of relations between racial and ethnic groups, manager of economic inequalities,
insurer of security, and arbiter of the acceptable uses of violence and surveillance.

“I confess,” French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the introduction to his Democracy in America, “that in America I saw more than America. I sought the image of
democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress.” What would Tocqueville see
if he returned to America today, almost 200 years later? What types of institutions, dynamics, and processes animate American political life in the twenty-first century? With

240

Tocqueville as a guide to thinking about political ethnography, this course investigates six central elements of political life—religion, education, civic engagement, difference,
representation, and crime and punishment—that simultaneously pose problems for and represent sites of progress in American democracy. For each subject, we will ask several
key questions. How has that particular aspect of political life changed in the recent past? How might it change in the near future? Does it conform to how American politics is
designed to work? To how we want American politics to work? Using a diverse set of readings drawn from empirical political science, contemporary democratic theory, American political thought, historical documents, political punditry (from the left and the right), and current events, our focus, like Tocqueville before us, is on teasing out both the lived
experience—the character and challenges—of American democracy and examining any disconnect between that experience and the ideals that undergird it. Among the many
specific questions we will consider are the extent to which America is a religious nation, whether recent changes in higher education have affected the health of democratic
politics, the effects of technology on civic engagement, and the place of the jury system in securing democratic justice. Throughout the semester, we will not only approach these
questions from the joint perspectives of theory and practice but also seek to enrich our understanding by exploring American democracy as it happens all around us with several
exercises in the community at large.
Format: discussion. Requirements: two experiential projects with accompanying write-ups of at least 5 and 7 pages, six 2- to 3-page ethnographic reflections, and class participation.
Prerequisites: a previous course in American politics or political theory or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as PSYC 345)
Political psychology studies human nature so as to understand politics. For example, many political philosophers begin their political programs by asserting some foundational
claims about “human nature” which in turn led them to their justification for their vision of politics. For example, the enlightenment thinkers held that science and technology
would strengthen rationality and thereby making democracy more viable. On the other hand, those who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general
public is incapable of rationality and of self-rule and should therefor accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity for
and willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens and as leaders. The course pays special attention to the
powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important variants, moral and political
judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and liberty for one and all among us? Political psychology is one of the very oldest
disciplines (it can be dated at least back to the early classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). The issue of citizen competence for self and collective rule, then as
now, was at the center of their attention. So, it shall be in this course.

PSCI 312T(S) American Political Thought (Same as LEAD 312T) (W)
From democracy to liberty, equality to community, foundational ideas—about what makes for good government, about what constitutes the good society, about what is necessary to lead a good life—define the American political tradition and consume the American political imagination. Designed not only to uncover these (sometimes melodious,
sometimes cacophonous) values but also to place current ideological debates about them in a broader developmental context, this tutorial will offer a topical tour of American
political thinking from the birth of nationalism in the colonial period to the remaking of conservatism and liberalism in the early twenty-first century. Utilizing primary source
material ranging from presidential speeches to party platforms, newspaper editorials to novels, we will seek to interrogate—reconciling where possible, distinguishing where
necessary, interpreting in all instances—the disparate visions and assessments of the American political experience offered by politicians, artists, intellectuals, activists, and
ordinary citizens over the course of more than two centuries. Our focus, then, is nothing less than the story of America-as told by those who lived it.

PSCI 314(F) Leadership in American Political Development (Same as LEAD 314) (W)
From the Founding to the present, the American political order has undergone incredible, cataclysmic and thoroughgoing transformations, yet it has also proven to be remarkably
enduring. How can this be? Where do we find continuities and where upheavals? What accounts for the continuities, and what for the changes? What sorts of transformations
have been possible, and who or what has made them possible?
Finally, what are the costs of change (and of continuity)—and who pays them?
The goal of this course is to assess American political change, or lack of, and to gain a sense of the role that individual leaders have played in driving change. We will examine
when and how individual agency and leadership has mattered vis-à-vis broader historical and contextual factors, including economic developments, demographic change, and
constitutional and institutional parameters. After examining general models of change and of leadership, we will consider specific case studies, such as civil rights for AfricanAmericans, gender equality, labor demands, and social conservatism. We will consider some of the complicated legacies of change. Finally, we will look at arguments that
America has been “exceptional”—or, unlike other countries—as well as critiques of these arguments, to help us gain an understanding of future prospects for political transformation.

PSCI 315(S) Parties in American Politics (W)
Political parties have played a central role in extending democracy and organizing power in the United States, yet their worth is a continuing subject of debate. In
one ideal formulation, parties not only link citizens to their government, they also provide the coherency and unity needed to govern in a political system in which
power is widely dispersed. But there is also an American tradition of antipathy toward parties. They have been criticized by some for inflaming divisions among the people and
for grid-locking the government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful choices; the Republican and Democratic parties are likened to
a choice between “tweedledee and tweedledum.” This course will investigate this debate over parties by examining their nature and role in American political life,
both past and present. Throughout the course, we will explore such questions as: What constitutes a party? How have the parties changed over time? For whom
do they function? Why a two-party system, and what role do third parties play? Is partisanship good or bad for democracy? For governance? We will seek answers to these
questions both in seminar discussion and through substantial independent research projects.

Politics as usual. It’s a phenomenon we all love to hate. But what does it mean? When government policy is decided by politics, does that mean the policy is necessarily bad? Can
we get rid of politics in policy making, or improve on it somehow? What would “politics as unusual” look like anyway? This class examines the policy making process with
particular emphasis on the United States: How do issues get defined as problems worthy of government attention? What kinds of alternatives are considered as solutions to these
problems? Why do we end up with some policies but not others? Do certain kinds of processes yield better policies than others? How should we decide what constitutes a good
policy?

PSCI 318T(S) Declining Significance of Race and Racism in U.S. Politics? (W)
Historically, America has faced a dilemma. On one hand, the United States was founded on the principles of liberty and equality, and consequently the American ethos is largely
characterized by individualism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, the U.S. has faced and continues to be challenged with matching its expectations and ideals of itself with
reality, as there are on-going inequalities based on race, gender, religion, and sexuality. Nonetheless, one would have difficulty in arguing that American society has not improved
at all, especially over the past half-century. The U.S. government—via Congress, the Supreme Court, and Executive Orders of various Presidents—has improved the well-being
and status of racial minorities. Further, the overwhelming majority of American citizens eschew racist language and attacks on racial and ethnic minorities. Some would argue
that the election of the United States’ first Black president is a clear indication that the country is approaching—if not already realizing—its post-racial, American Dream. But,
scholars who have tried to measure the significance, impact, and effect of race on American politics are currently engaged in a highly contested debate on the extent to which
racism has declined in this society. In this tutorial, we will explore a variety of debates concerning the role of race in American society and American Politics. Have racial attitudes
improved over the past 60 years or has the language of racial animus simply changed over that time? Are racial minorities failing to live up the opportunities provided to them by
the U.S. Constitution and various other laws or are there structural barriers that are too high for them to overcome? Is the election of minority leaders in majority white districts a
sign that racial attitudes have an insignificant influence on candidate evaluation and elections or have minority candidates deracialized their campaigns in a way that may ultimately disserve minority groups? These are just a few of the questions we will consider. Students will be exposed to texts on at least two sides of various debates.

PSCI 324(F) International Legitimation (W)
In theory, self-determination means that it is those who are ruled who decide who rules them and how. In practice, not only do pervasive international, foreign and universal
standards influence what type of government people believe to be acceptable and desirable, but international actors also rule directly on the legitimacy of a regime’s policy or on
the regime itself. Individual countries have always sought to change others, and following wars, countries have often collectively enforced peace terms. It is multilateral institutions ruling in peacetime that is relatively new. This research seminar investigates organized international, multilateral attempts to mold a delinquent country’s domestic politics
by enforcing extranational standards. We investigate three types of cases: UN Security Council threats and condemnations, international criminal prosecutions, and international
election monitoring. All students read common secondary materials and engage in research design workshops; each will write (and rewrite) an independent research paper
grounded in primary sources.

Consider a photograph taken from space of the Earth at night. What will you see? Great agglomerations of light in some parts of the world (North America, Western Europe, parts
of East Asia) contrasted with vast expanses of darkness in others (much of Central and South America, Southeast Asia and nearly all of Africa). This pattern of light and darkness
depicts a vastly unequal global distribution of technology, urban infrastructure, capital accumulation —in short, the global patterns of development and underdevelopment. What
makes some areas ‘light’ and some areas ‘dark’? More importantly, how are these areas connected—both within and across national boundaries—through trade and capital
flows, political authority, violence and the natural environment? What are the relations between development and underdevelopment?
This course is an investigation of political, economic and societal growth (or lack thereof) and change in the Global North and Global South through the lenses of Political
Economy and Political Ecology. We will focus in particular on the global factors influencing development and underdevelopment, political-economic connections across national borders, and the intersections of power, production and nature. During our course of study we will cover: global patterns of inequality and their history; development strategies;
the politics of population control; the intersections of power, violence, and nature; and finally, the prospects of development for all.

PSCI 330 Existentialism and Politics (Not offered 2013-2014)
If the classical imperative was to “know thyself,” then the modern one is simply to “be yourself.” The call to authenticity can be heard not only in popular culture, but also in
many of the new social movements such as feminism, ethnic consciousness movements, and anti-colonial movements. Is there an essential way of being that underpins distinct
ethnic, national, or gender identities? And what exactly constitutes this “self” that one is asked, quite simply, to be? Course readings critically examine the idea of authenticity,
casting it in light of philosophical debates on existence, the nature of being, the idea of the self, and the role of individual experience in generating identities and subjectivities. We
will begin with Kierkegaard’s account of the singularity of one’s own existence and the dimensions of individuality that cannot be captured by traditional ethics and philosophical
categories. We will then move on to discuss other conceptions of being-with-oneself and with others, reading such thinkers as Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul
Sartre, Albert Camus, Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi and Simone de Beauvoir. These thinkers prompt us to think not only about our existence, but also about the political, social,
and economic relations that condition our being and becoming.

PSCI 331(S) Knowledge and Politics
Is there a form of knowledge proper to politics? What are the risks and promise of turning to the sciences to supply or guarantee that knowledge (as we do, in different ways, when
we call the study of politics “Political Science” or when we call for “science-based policies”)? In this class, we will engage several recent works at the intersection of political
theory and science studies that reopen the question of science’s proper relationship to politics. These works challenge critical theory’s traditional assumption that scientific
knowledge is, at best, impotent and, at worst, imperious in the context of politics. Yet in defining a more productive role for the sciences in politics, they do not take for granted
that science is what its traditional advocates often took it to be: objective, dispassionate... in short, a-political. Works we will consider may include William Connolly’s Neuropolitics, Isabelle Stengers The Invention of Modern Science, Karen Barad’s Meeting the Universe Halfway, Bruno Latour’s Politics of Nature, Mark Brown’s Science in Democracy, and Joseph Rouse’s Knowledge and Power.

PSCI 332 Rethinking the Political (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
What is politics? The question, an important part of political theory at least since Socrates, has taken on renewed significance in recent years, as theorists have sought to rethink
the political in response to the most disastrous of twentieth century political developments, to assorted identity-based struggles that have challenged prevailing political terms and
arrangements, and to the transformations wrought by “globalization.” This seminar engages some of the major attempts at rethinking produced in the 20th and 21st centuries,
particularly at those that challenge, rework, or seek to move beyond liberalism. We will pay particular attention to the work of Carl Schmitt, probably the most probing and
significant authoritarian thinker of the twentieth century, and to such figures as Sheldon Wolin, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Rancière and, especially, Hannah Arendt. Among our
questions: Can liberal pluralism be transcended or supplemented without producing something akin to the fascism embraced by Schmitt? Does the tradition of radical democracy
offer a distinctive and credible conception of politics, or is it parasitic upon a liberalism it won’t avow? Is there some essence, or sphere, or mode of being or acting that we can
usefully call, “the political”—and why is there such a preoccupation with the political now? Does this preoccupation help us better to engage the forces and circumstances that
structure politics in the contemporary world, or does it lead us to obscure them?

PSCI 333 The Sublime in Politics and Political Thought (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course examines discourses on terror, wonder and awe from the Enlightenment to the present, using the idea of the sublime to rethink important events like the French
Revolution and the recent War on Terror. The sublime has meant different things to a great number of thinkers in the Western philosophical tradition, going back to a treatise
attributed to Longinus, a 1st century Greek rhetoretician. Longinus was concerned with the power of great poets to “elevate” their audiences, transporting them beyond the limits
of their comprehension through mixtures of terror, wonder and awe. How did this old text focusing on experiences beyond the rational come to hold such fascination for philosophers and political thinkers during the Age of Enlightenment? What is the relationship between current events in politics and public culture and the recent revival of scholarly
interest in the sublime? Beyond revolution and war, course readings will explore the limits of human comprehension and apprehension in environmental politics, debates over
fetal rights, and the fear of confronting people different from ourselves. Though we will regularly take up examples drawn from the worlds of art, literature, politics, and the mass
media, our central focus will be on the careful reading of philosophical and critical texts, including Kant’s Critique of Judgment and writings from among the following authors:
Edmund Burke, Friedrich Schiller, G.F.W. Hegel, Slavoj Zizek, Hannah Arendt, Bonnie Mann, Christine Battersby, and Jean-François Lyotard.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular class participation, three papers (3 pages, 7 pages and 8-10 pages).

PSCI 334(S) Theorizing Global Justice
While economic exchanges, cultural convergence, and technological innovations have brought people in different parts of the world closer together than ever before, globalization has also amplified differences in material wealth and social inequalities. Ill health, inadequate sanitation, and lack of access to safe drinking water are increasingly common.
Yet, more than ever before, the means exist in affluent regions of the world to alleviate the worst forms of suffering and enhance the well-being of the poorest people. How are we
to understand this contradiction as a matter of justice? What is the relationship between justice and equality, and what do we owe one another in a deeply divided world? Course
readings will engage your thinking on the central debates in moral philosophy, normative approaches to international political economy, and grassroots efforts to secure justice for
women and other severely disadvantaged groups. Key theorists include John Rawls, Onora O’Neill, Thomas Pogge, Paul Farmer, Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Manfred
Steger, Saskia Sassen, Susan George, Vandana Shiva, Majid Rahnema and Gustavo Esteva.

PSCI 336T(F) Thomas Hobbes and the Body Politic (W)
Thomas Hobbes is justly regarded as the greatest and most ambitious of English language political theorists. He is a major figure in the history of ideas about human nature,
society, the state, sovereignty, war, power, consent, language, materialism, knowledge, and perception. Writing in a time of violent passions and revolutionary upheaval, he
sought to explain how the political world is held together and how it comes apart. Although he was a brilliant prose stylist and lucid analyst, Hobbes is challenging to read, not
only because of the depth of the questions he asks and the intricacy of his answers but also because it is difficult to place his views within familiar contemporary frameworks. He
can be seen, for example, as both a progenitor of modern liberalism and one who undermines liberal pieties. How, then, should we understand his political aspirations and assess
his political legacy? This tutorial aims to allow students to respond in a way rarely possible in the undergraduate curriculum: by considering several of Hobbes’s major works, and
reading his masterpiece, Leviathan, in its entirety. Although our central focus will be on the works themselves, we will explore their historical context, examine how they have
been important to some key theorists of recent times, and engage contemporary interpretive battles over the character of Hobbes’s politics.

PSCI 337(F) Visual Politics (Same as ARTH 337) (W)
Even casual observers know that appearances matter politically and that the saturation of politics by visual technologies, media, and images has reached unprecedented levels.
Yet the visual dimensions of political life are, at best, peripheral topics in contemporary political science and political theory. This seminar explores how our understanding of
politics and political theory might change if visuality were made central to our inquiries. Treating the visual as a site of power and struggle, order and change, we will examine not
only how political institutions and conflicts shape what images people see and how they make sense of them but also how the political field itself is visually constructed. Through
these explorations, which will consider a wide variety of visual examples, we will also take up fundamental theoretical questions about the place of the senses in political life.
Readings may include relevant excerpts from ancient and modern theorists, but our primary focus will be contemporary and will bring political theory into conversation with
such fields as art history and criticism, film studies, psychoanalysis, affect theory, and cognitive science. Possible authors include Arendt, Azoulay, Bal, Barthes, Benjamin,
Bruno, Buck-Morss, Butler, Clark, Connolly, Crimp, Deleuze, Elkins, Fanon, Foucault, Hobbes, Lacan, Merleau-Ponty, Mitchell, Mulvey, Noë, Plato, Rancière, Rogin, Scott,

PSCI 339 Politics and Aesthetics (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In recent years, political theorists have grown increasingly preoccupied with questions of what since the Romantic era has been called “aesthetics.” In a moment of global
economic crisis, amidst continuing problems of war, violence, poverty, and injustice, this concern may seem puzzling, even fundamentally misplaced. Yet just as Plato, for
instance, famously connected questions of the good and the true to those of the beautiful (so that it is anachronistic to impute to him a separation between political and aesthetic
domains), some notable recent theorists claim that investigating aesthetic matters can enable us to gain a better understanding of political perceptions, ideals, aspirations,
struggles, and possibilities. Among the main questions we will ask in this seminar is whether or not that claim is persuasive. Along the way, we will we will pay sustained
attention to such matters as the role of emotion, affect, and the senses in political life, the nature of aesthetic judgment, its relationship to both political judgment and structures of
power, and the similarities and differences between making art and acting politically. We will also, of course, examine what it means to call something “aesthetic,” and we will
think about the limits of the aesthetic as a category of analysis. Though we will regularly take up examples drawn from the worlds of art, politics, and the mass media, our central
focus will be on the careful reading of philosophical and critical texts, including Kant’s Critique of Judgment and writings from among the following authors: Adorno, Arendt,
Bal, Benjamin, Bourdieu, Burke, Cavell, Danto, Deleuze, Dickie, Felski, Freud, Hegel, Heidegger, Hume, Mill, Nietzsche, Ramachandran, Rancière, Schiller.

This course considers the origins of political violence and state failure at the end of the 20th century. It seeks to address why there was a resurgence of political violence at the
dawn of the 21st century. Toward that end, we begin by considering competing explanations of political violence (ethnicity, democratization, natural-resource endowments, and
predatory elites). We then move on to the empirical section of the course in which we cover case studies of state failure in parts of Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Intolerance and justice are linked in that each defines what can and should be done to others, and what we expect in return. One of the goals of the Enlightenment was to find a
solution to the problem of intolerance and the violence that was and is its frequent companion. One core expectation was that progress would result from expanding knowledge.
Progress would enable reason to replace dogmatism and faith (especially fighting faiths), progress in understanding the new economics of trade and the politics of liberality
would produce commonwealths, producing more cosmopolitan societies marked by justice, enduring peace and prosperity. Moreover, democracy would spread thereby integrating more nations into the democratic camp. And, the lives of the many would improve. That vision has lost its promise. The 20th century, for all its economic and technological
improvements, was also witness to terrible intolerance, attacks on civilians in war, ethnic purging has continued even after the holocaust. Intolerance led to wars between states, to
violence within states (such as Darfur, Sri Lanka, Bosnia to name but three). Hence, the three questions posed by this course: 1) What are the most important factors that continue
to produce intolerance; 2) Are the factors that produce and strengthen justice and tolerance; and 3) What can be done to increase a society’s tolerance and justice, both in the
United States and abroad? This course makes use of historical, political, and literary sources.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm examination, medium length research paper, and final examination.

PSCI 344T The Political Theory of Liberal Economics (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course deals with the economic and political writings of four important economists—Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, Freidrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. Although all are remembered primarily as economists, they also engaged in writing political theory. This course will examine the political assumptions and implications of their
economic thought and where they agree and disagree, particularly the role they assign to the state in constructing and sustaining markets. How do they conceive of the origin of
markets? What role does the state play in making, supervising, and maintaining markets? Do the economists conceive of the state in similar terms and, especially, do the more
libertarian economists really proceed as if markets are self-generated and spontaneous? What is it that economic theorists have the state doing? What is their implicit theory of the
state?

PSCI 345 Cosmology and Rulership in Ancient Chinese Political Thought (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This class will involve students in close reading of, and exegetical writing about, core texts of ancient Chinese political thought. The purpose is to gain an understanding of a
number of different perspectives on politics and leadership, especially Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism. While the primary focus will be on the meaning of the texts in the
context of their own times, contemporary applications of core concepts will also be considered. The class will begin with background readings, since no prior work in Chinese
philosophy or history is assumed. Then the class will read significant portions of the following canonical works: The Analects, Mencius, the Daodejing, Zhuangzi, and Han Feizi.

PSCI 350T (formerly 352T) Comparative Political Economy (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This tutorial provides an introduction to comparative political economy by focusing on an enduring puzzle: the spread of capitalism led to both transitions to democracy and
dictatorship/authoritarianism. How is it that the expansion of markets led to the birth of democracy in some countries, but dictatorships in others? What, if any, is the relationship
between economic development and the organization of power (regime type)? Does economic development lead to the spread of democracy? Or is economic crisis the key to
understanding the conditions under which dictatorships fall? To answer these questions we read works by Moore, Lipset, Schumpeter, Przeworski, Rueschemeyer et al., Haggard
& Kaufman, among others.

PSCI 351(F) The New Left and Neoliberalism in Latin America (W)
Recent years have seen a resurgence of the political left in Latin America. This course seeks to understand the origins of this new left, the ideas and character of its protagonists,
the neoliberal philosophy it opposes, and the arena of democratic politics it inhabits today. We first read polemics from both sides, before stepping back to consider Latin American political economy, including the twentieth-century left, from a more historical and analytical perspective. With this preparation, we then look more closely at major contemporary figures and movements in Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, and other countries. After considering explanations of the rise of the left and assessments of its performance in power, we end our common readings by asking what it might mean today to be on the left in Latin America—or anywhere—both in policy and political terms.

PSCI 355T(F) Realism (W)
Realism in politics is both an approach to international relations and a political sensibility. As a sensibility, it values limits, questions good intentions, and worries about grand
ambitions. It takes the basic contours of human behavior as given and beyond the control of actors to alter, perhaps giving rise to a kind of passivity in response. The realist
sensibility tends to doubt the efficacy of human action, to believe that attempts to improve the terms of human interaction not only are doomed to fail but also are likely to make
things worse. Realists are not necessarily conservative--a few are radical--but they have learned much from conservatives. By temperament, they are not confident of the capacities of human agencies.
Realism also is a distinct approach to the conduct and the study of international relations. Realists have basic tenets--states are primary actors and operate to increase their relative
power in a world in which anarchy puts a premium on self-help--that guide their thinking about international relations, but the readings on realism in international relations will
highlight the underlying politics of realists. We will consider the realist emphasis on power, the status of morality, the relationship between power and morality, what critics of
realists have to say about the realist treatment of these issues, and how realism in international relations connects with realism as a political sensibility. We will read works by Carr,
Greene, Kissinger, Lenin, Machiavelli, Mearsheimer, Orwell, and Waltz.

PSCI 362T(S) The Wilsonian Tradition in American Foreign Policy (Same as LEAD 362T) (W)
During and after the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson developed an approach to international relations that challenged the dominant assumptions of Realism. Instead
of a world order marked by alliances, arms races, and wars, Wilson offered a vision of a peaceful world and the rule of international law. While America ultimately rejected the
League of Nations, the Wilsonian tradition has continued to exert a powerful influence on scholars and policymakers. This tutorial will intensively examine Wilson’s efforts to
recast the nature of the international system, the American rejection of his vision after the First World War, and the reshaping of Wilsonianism after the Second World War. We
will spend equal time in the tutorial on both the theoretical and historical dimensions of Wilsonianism.

PSCI 365(S) U.S. Grand Strategy (Same as LEAD 365) (W)
This course examines how U.S. leaders have conceived of their nation’s place in the world and sought to use power to achieve national objectives. We will consider military
affairs, economics, and diplomacy, but the class is mostly concerned with ideas. How have leaders from James Madison to George W. Bush thought about U.S. vulnerabilities,
resources, and goals, and how have those ideas influenced foreign policy decisions? How did key leaders balance competing objectives and navigate difficult international
circumstances? Which leaders were successful in managing U.S. statecraft, and which were not? Which leaders developed coherent grand strategies? What lessons might we
derive for our own times from studying this history? The course will sweep across American history but will not attempt to be exhaustive in any way. Rather, it will focus on
certain moments that highlight changing grand strategic thought. We will carefully consider, for example, the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, continental expansion in the
Manifest Destiny period, the Civil War, overseas expansion in the late nineteenth century, the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, the Second World War, the Cold War, and the “War
on Terror.”
Possible texts include Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, The Federalist Papers; Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power Upon History; George Kennan, American Diplomacy; Richard Immerman, Empire for Liberty; Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy; James McPherson, Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief; and a collection of

How do political scientists, historians, and international relations theorists effectively carry out original and productive research projects? This course seeks to introduce students
to the practical methods of political and historical inquiry. Working almost exclusively with primary sources and recently declassified documents, this class will examine selected
aspects of American foreign relations. Rather than simply reading existing scholarly literature in this area, the goal of this class is to enable students to produce original scholarship based on an examination of primary documents instead of through a reliance on secondary sources. In consultation with the professor, students will have the option of
pursuing either individual or engaging in collective research projects.

PSCI 410 Senior Seminar in American Politics: Civic Education in America (Not offered 2013-2014)
Despite the fact that, according to a recent poll by the National Constitution Center, 8 in 10 Americans believe that democratic government requires an informed and active
citizenry, fewer than 4 in 10 can name the three branches of the federal government. Whether or not we regard this particular encyclopedic fact as especially important, few
disagree with the idea that, when it comes to politics and citizenship, Americans are an ill-informed people. But what exactly would we want Americans to know more about?
And how exactly might we get them to learn it? Taking these questions as its starting points, this senior seminar will tackle the state of civic education in America—its promise
and its pitfalls, its past iterations and its practice in contemporary times. In the first half of the semester, we will look closely at a series of debates about the goals, substance, and
effect of civic education, including whether (and why) we should want it, what exactly it can and should look like (perhaps looking to civic education in other nations for
meaningful points of comparison), and what sorts of effects it may have on citizens individually and the polity at large. In the second half of the semester, we will seek to put what
we have learned into action, with students selecting a particular subject (an institution, a value, a process) and developing a civic education curriculum around it for introduction at
several distinct grade levels in local schools. Embodying the idea that you never know something as thoroughly and meaningfully as you might until you have taught it, this
seminar will seek simultaneously to deepen our own civic knowledge and practices and to cultivate more meaningful knowledge and practices in others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one or two short essays, class participation, and a multi-part experiential project culminating in a class presentation and a 15- to 20-page paper.
Prerequisites: senior standing in Political Science or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 13). Preference given to senior (and then junior) Political

PSCI 410(F) Senior Seminar in American Politics: Interpretations of American Politics
Current assessments of the state of American politics vary widely. Though recent polls show that as many as 60 percent of Americans think that the country is headed down the
wrong-track, it is not clear what that means. Critics on the left worry that the United States is on an imperial quest, extorting resources from the global many for the advantage of
an elite few. Critics on the right worry that the U.S. has abandoned the traditions that made it strong and has entered a period of moral decay. What are we to make of these
different assessments? What do left and right see when they survey the nation, and why is what they see so different? Any diagnosis of contemporary maladies is premised on a
vision of what a healthy functioning republic looks like. Our task in the seminar is to uncover and interrogate those visions. We will do this by exploring different interpretations
of American politics, each with its own story of narrative tensions and possible resolutions. We will then use our investigation of how different authors, and different traditions,
understand the nation to help us assess contemporary politics and come to our own conclusions about what animates it.
Format: seminar. Requirements: brief weekly writing assignments; two short essays; a 15-page research paper; and oral presentation.

PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics: The Politics of Belonging
In his acceptance speech on November 7, 2012, President Obama stated that he believes “we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you’re willing to work hard, it
doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love. It doesn’t matter whether you’re black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native
American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it here in America if you’re willing to try.” Although many people have described America
as inclusive, political debates about belonging have often been contentious, hard-fought, and discouraging for those sharing President Obama’s views. This seminar will focus on
the politics of belonging in America. What does it mean to be an American? If the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, why is immigration reform so difficult to achieve? Are legal
citizenship and formal political rights sufficient for belonging? Or does full inclusion rest on the ability to exercise civil and social rights as well? Does income inequality threaten
the political equality necessary for a strong democracy? As we examine the debates over inclusion, we will consider different views about the relationship among political, civil,
and social rights as well as different interpretations of American identity, politics, and democracy.

2013-2014 (W)
The idea that all humans have rights simply because they are human—independent of anything they might do or achieve—has transformed local and international politics,
probably permanently. This concept’s place in international politics, its strengths and limitations, depend on how people use it. Beginning with the 18th-century’s transatlantic
movement to abolish slavery, we will examine international movements and institutions that have affected what human rights mean, to whom, and where. Readings draw on
philosophy, history, sociology, and international relations, but as a political science class we emphasize politics. Who benefits from the idea of universal human rights? Who
loses? How does this idea about individual value liberate and entrap? Does this idea ultimately reinforce American hegemony, or plant the seeds of a non-American order?

Before the 1990s, the world saw only occasional, discrete war crimes trials after major-power cataclysms. In the last two decades, trials expanded dramatically in number, scope,
and philosophy. Separate Ad Hoc Tribunals for crimes in Yugoslavia and those in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone and in Cambodia are giving way to a permanent International
Criminal Court, which has begun to hand down indictments and refine its jurisdiction. At the same time, worries about residual impunity or the effect that punishment might have
on societies’ futures has led to the development of national and social courts to complement those at the international level. Models of transitional justice abound. This capstone
seminar examines the intent, process, meaning and consequence of these new institutions, particularly in terms of national constitutions, international law, and principles of

At the beginning of the 20th century, Europe was at the center of world politics and the main player in the balance of power while America was a peripheral player in the
international system. American involvement in European affairs was strictly limited. By the end of the 20th century, the states of Western Europe would become greatly integrated and the threat of war was virtually abolished. No longer an isolationist power, America would become intimately involved in every facet of European and world politics.
This course examines this great and fundamental transformation of the international system. We will examine American involvement in both of the world wars, the defense of
Europe during the Cold War, decolonization, and the uneven but steady development of European unity and integration in the second half of the 20th century.

years to bring the war to a close. Whether the war could have ended earlier, or whether the peace settlement represented a betrayal of our South Vietnamese allies, are questions
that continue to be fiercely debated by historians and political scientists. This course will examine the diplomacy of war termination and the strategy for ending the war pursued

This course explores two major themes emerging from the work of theorists associated with the Frankfurt School: the critique of progress, Enlightenment and modernity, and the
recuperation of certain Enlightenment ideals and hopes for progress in new, aesthetic forms. The first part of the course looks at Karl Marx’s critique of alienation and reification,
asking how Marx’s ideas are picked up and modified in the writings of Georg Lukacs, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. We will also pay attention to the influence of Freud
on Herbert Marcuse’s critique of civilization. The second part of the course turns to the writings of Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch, whose efforts to reconstruct emancipatory
ideals in Marxist thought after the collapse of communist and socialist teleologies have been described as “maverick” and “utopian.” Among our questions: What is the price of
progress? What are the prospects for freedom in modern societies, where individuality, down to the very structure of our instincts and drives, is shaped by mass culture and social
institutions? Can agency and subjectivity be recovered within a “totally administered society?” What may we hope?

Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 6: Other/Interdisciplinary Psychology (courses with middle digit 6)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical Lab Course.
PSYC 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues

Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The department requires that 201 be completed by the end of the junior year.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas, but they must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and write a thesis
based on original empirical work. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guidelines for pursuing the degree with
honors are available from the department.

STUDY ABROAD
With some advance planning, studying abroad (especially for one semester) can easily be worked into the psychology major. To facilitate this, we recommend that students:
1) meet with the Study Abroad advisor as soon as they decide that they are interested in studying abroad
2) take Psychology 201 (Experimentation and Statistics) in the sophomore year
3) think ahead to the 300-level courses they are interested in taking so that they can fulfill the 200-level prerequisites before they go away or, if possible, while they are away.
In our experience, study abroad programs in the following places are most likely to offer psychology courses: England, Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Australia, New Zealand,
Hawaii, and Scandinavia. Students should procure the descriptions of the psychology courses they are considering taking and bring them to their meeting with the
advisor.
There are some costs to studying away, particularly for the year. This limits students’ opportunities to choose the particular 300-level courses they would like to take and they
must sometimes settle for those that are open, those which happen to be offered, or those for which they have the prerequisites, once they return in their senior year. Many students
who are keen on psychology begin doing research with professors during their junior year, and for some this leads to an honors thesis in the senior year, summer research, etc. If
you are going away for the entire year and do not make such connections with a professor ahead of time (i.e., before you go), you may lose out on some of these opportunities to
deepen your involvement in the major on campus. On the other hand, studying abroad can be an invaluable learning experience, so you need to think carefully, in consultation
with your advisor and/or the Study Abroad advisor, about the costs and benefits of it. Very occasionally, a student who just begins taking psychology courses late in the sophomore year and wishes to go abroad for the year finds that he/she is not able to do both, or is restricted in the choice of study-abroad programs.

This course introduces students to a broad range of theories and research on education. What models of teaching work best, and for what purposes? How do we measure the
success of various education practices? What is the best way to describe the psychological processes by which children gain information and expertise? What accounts for
individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) address these individual needs? How do social and economic factors shape teaching practices and the
educational experiences of individual students? The course will draw from a wide range of literature (research, theory, and first hand accounts) to consider key questions in the
psychology of education. Upon completion of the course, students should be familiar with central issues in pre-college education and know how educational research and the

PSYC 317T Nature via Nurture: The Psychobiology of Danger (Same as NSCI 317T) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course examines the relative contributions of nature (genetics) and nurture (the environment) to the neurobiology of aggression and fear, leading to individual differences in
behavior in dangerous situations. We will evaluate the neuroscience literature to arrive at an understanding of the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry underlying behaviors that
create danger (e.g. violence, child abuse, antisocial behavior, alcohol abuse) and behaviors that respond to danger (e.g. inhibition, risk-taking, stress responses, empathy). Modern
neuroscience techniques, such as brain imaging, selective trait breeding and gene mapping, have discovered new relationships between genes and behavior. However, recent
studies on the effects of social and cognitive factors suggest critical environmental influences on the expression of these genetic determinants.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor for an hour each week; each week, students will either present an oral argument of a 5-page position
paper or respond to their partners’ paper.
Prerequisites: PSYC 212 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors and Neuroscience concentrators.

ZIMMERBERG

PSYC 318(F) Image, Imaging and Imagining: The Brain and Visual Arts (Same as INTR 223 and NSCI 318)
This course will study the intersections of neuroscience and art. The brain interprets the visual world and generates cognitive and emotional responses to what the eyes see. It is
also responsible for creating mental images and then directing the artist’s motor output. We will first examine the neural mechanisms of how we perceive what we see. We will
investigate how visual artists have used or challenged perceptual cues in their work. Understanding how the brain perceives faces will be used to analyze portraiture. We will
consider the influence of neurological and psychological disorders on artistic work. We will examine neuroimaging studies questioning whether the brains of visual artists are
specialized differently from non-artists. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists are using brain images in their artwork, and how “outsider” artists have portrayed brain
syndromes and mental states. Students will create their own artwork in response to the course material, culminating in a class exhibit. The class will include field trips to local
museums.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, several presentations, and a final project.
Prerequisites: PSYC 101, ARTH 101-102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference: for registration under INTR, Studio Art majors; for
registration under PSYC or NSCI, Psychology majors and Neuroscience concentrators.

PSYC 319T(F) Neurofiction
Increasingly, neuroscience is not only a topic of interest to academics and clinicians, but also to the general public. Cover stories in the major news magazines over the past year
include Alzheimer’s disease, autism, depression, memory, traumatic brain injury in athletes, and schizophrenia. Television news and newspapers cover studies related to neuroscience on a daily basis. Increasingly, novels and movies focus on neuroscience topics. This tutorial will use movies and popular press fiction as a starting point for analysis and
discussion of contemporary topics in neuroscience. We will use these movies and novels as “case histories” to provide a foundation for discussing contemporary and controversial topics in neuroscience. Students will begin each topic by viewing a film or reading a book that portrays a topic in neuroscience. Each film/book will serve as a launching point
for in depth discussion and debate of the neuroscientific issues raised in the film/book. For example, the film A Beautiful Mind raises issues regarding the neurobiological basis
and treatment of schizophrenia and the film Memento raises many controversial issues surrounding the neurobiology of memory.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week; during each meeting, students will either present a 6- to 8-page position

PSYC 322(F) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
Every time we see something as a kind of thing, every time that we decide that an object is a cup rather than a glass, when we recognize a picture of a familiar face as a picture of
ourselves, or even when we understand speech, we are employing categories. Most categorization decisions are automatic and unconscious, and therefore have the illusion of
simplicity. The complexity of these decisions, however, becomes apparent when we attempt to build machines to do what humans perform so effortlessly. What are the systems
in place that allow us this extraordinary ability to segment the world? Are they universal? How does conceptual knowledge differ across cultural groups? How do concepts affect
our perception? How do the categories of experts differ from the categories of novices? Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults? How are categories
represented in the brain? In this course, we explore various empirical findings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these questions.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short papers, class presentation, and research paper.
Prerequisites: PSYC 221 or 222 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to Psychology majors and Cognitive Science concentrators.

PSYC 324T Great Debates in Cognition (Not offered 2013-2014)
The field of cognition is filled with controversies about how the mind really works. For example, is there sufficient evidence for a system in vision that can become aware of
things without actually “seeing” them? Is it necessary to assume that babies come into the world armed with innate linguistic knowledge? Are humans inherently rational? Can
we make inference about the mind using neuroimaging? These debates, and others that we will consider, help fuel scientific discovery in cognition in interesting ways. In this
class, we will consider some of these contemporary debates, weigh evidence on both sides, and discuss the implications for what we know about the mind.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for an hour each week. Evaluation will be based on weekly papers and oral arguments.
Prerequisites: PSYC 221 or 222 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors and Cognitive Science concentrators.
ZAKI
PSYC 326 Choice and Decision Making (Not offered 2013-2014)
One aspect of ”being human” is that we often make choices that we know are bad for us. In this course we survey theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding our
strengths and weaknesses as decision makers. Topics include normative decision theories, biases in probability judgments, ”fast and frugal” heuristics, impulsiveness and selfcontrol, addictions and bad habits, gambling, and moral decision making.
Format: seminar. Requirements: essay papers and class participation.
Prerequisites: PSYC 221 or 222 or permission of instructor. Permission is typically given to students who have successfully completed ECON 110. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to senior Psychology majors who need the course to fulfill the major.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
KIRBY
PSYC 327(S) Cognition and Education
This course will examine the cognitive processes underlying learning in educational settings. Students will come away with a richer understanding of how the mind encodes,
stores, and retrieves knowledge, and how learners monitor and manage their own learning. We will examine common educational practices and how they depart from what
research recommends. Although the class is primarily about cognition, we will delve into related topics such as motivation, determination, and inequality. Most of the readings
will be scientific research articles on cognition and/or education. Although this is not a lab class, we will design at least one study, collect data, and write about the results.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, short essays, midterm and final.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and PSYC 221 or 222, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Psychology majors.

KORNELL
PSYC 332 Cognitive Development (Not offered 2013-2014)
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination develop during the childhood years. We begin by asking how infants, who
do not have language, make sense of their world and then move on to examine the development of language, memory, reasoning, and imagination. Throughout these discussions,
we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes in the brain) and culture on cognition, as well as the similarities and differences in the cognitive abilities of normally developing
children and children with developmental problems (e.g., autism).
Format: seminar. Requirements: two hour exams, thought papers, and a final 10- to 15-page paper.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and PSYC 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference to Psychology majors.
KAVANAUGH
PSYC 333(S) Foundations of Cognition
This course will broadly cover various aspects of early cognitive development and will include topics such as memory, numerical cognition, language acquisition, and understanding of other social beings. We will focus on aspects of the human mind that are present early in life and explore how these early systems evolve into more mature cognition.
Students will be required to critically read seminal works that shaped the field and also examine new developments in the literature. All students will focus on a specific area of
interest by conducting an original empirical research project.
Format: empirical lab course. Requirements: active participation, regular thought papers and class presentations, midterm exam, written report and oral presentation on an original empirical research project.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and PSYC 232. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 12). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 334T(S) Magic, Superstition, and Belief (W)
In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama played a ritual game of basketball that he hoped would ensure good results while his opponent, John McCain kept a luckypenny in his pocket throughout the election season. These are but two striking examples of the millions of people who regularly engage in ritualistic or superstitious behavior. But
why? How did the mind evolve to support both logical reasoning and magical thinking? In this tutorial, we explore that question by examining how beliefs, emotions, and
imagination have interlocked in the course of human development. We will discuss and debate how the capacity to imagine facilitates problem solving, why magical thinking
continues in to adulthood, and how our beliefs in both natural and supernatural phenomena are related to the evolutionary forces that shaped the human mind.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week and be fully prepared to discuss the material. Each week, one member of
each pair will either write a 5- to 7-page paper (five papers in total), or respond in writing (one page) to the partner’s paper. Emphasis will be placed on constructing critical written
and oral arguments.
Prerequisites: PSYC 221 or 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 337 Temperament and Biobehavioral Development (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This class will explore individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation in infancy and childhood. Developmental, ethological, and neuroscience models will serve as the
foundation for the exploration of the construct of temperament. Topics will include biobehavioral models of reactivity to stress and novelty, including research examining individual differences in neuroendocrine, electrophysiological, and emotional responding. Individual differences in self-regulation will be explored, and will focus heavily on the
literature examining the development of attention and other executive control processes in infancy and early childhood. Longitudinal research that examines continuity and
change in temperament from infancy through adulthood will be examined. The contributions of genetics and the contextual influences on temperament trajectories will be
explored, including research demonstrating the influence of caregivers and gene-by-environment interactions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly thought papers and one final 7- to 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and 232 or PSYC 212 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 16). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 338(F) Childhood in Context
The psychological lives of children are shaped not only by internal changes, but also by the ways in which adults in their community view and treat them, as well as by other
situational forces (for instance poverty and social unrest). In this course students will consider how various external forces affect children’s daily experience. Students will
compare several psychological models of young children- some emanating from folk culture, and some from scientific paradigms. We will look at how parenting and educational
practices reflect the implicit models of childhood held by members of a community, and then examine whether those practices have a substantive or lasting effect on children. We
will also weigh the impact of certain non-parental features of the environment: poverty, wealth, social unrest, violence, societal well-being, and technological advances. Specific
questions we will consider in the course include (but are not limited to): What are the short and long term effects of growing up in a society with a formal model of teaching and
learning? In what ways is the psychological experience of poor children different than that of the middle class? Are children who grow up in rural areas different from those who
grow up in cities? What is the long term impact of growing up in a culture that does or does not value play?
We will draw on observational and experimental data, narrative non-fiction, and film, as well as the work of anthropologists and historians.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page papers.

PSYC 339(F) Imagination
Imagination refers to the capacity to mentally transcend time, place, and/or circumstance to think about what might have been, plan and anticipate the future, create fictional
worlds, and consider remote and close alternatives to actual experiences. This multi-faceted capacity emerges in early childhood and is fundamental to human thought throughout life. The study of imagination crosscuts traditional areas in psychology and extends into other fields as well (e.g., philosophy, literature). In this course we will examine how
psychologists think about and study human imagination, covering topics such as pretend play in children, counterfactual reasoning, imagery, mental time travel, creativity,
consciousness, fiction, dreaming, mental illness, and the impact of technology on concepts of self and identity. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: weekly response papers, 3-5 page book review, 15 page final paper and oral presentation of the empirical project.

PSYC 341(F) Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination (Same as WGSS 339) (D) (W)
This course will examine social psychological theories and research that are relevant to the understanding of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. We will take a variety of
social psychological perspectives, emphasizing sociocultural, cognitive, personality, or motivational explanations. We will examine the impact that stereotypes and prejudice
have on people’s perceptions of and behaviors toward particular groups or group members and will explore a variety of factors that tend to exacerbate or weaken this impact. We
also will consider some of the sources of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and some of the processes through which they are maintained, strengthened, or revised. In
addition, we will examine some of the effects that stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination can have on members of stereotyped groups, as well as some implications of the
social psychological research findings for issues such as education and business and government policies. A major component of this course will be the examination of classic
and ongoing empirical research.

PSYC 344 Advanced Research in Social Psychology (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will focus on the process of doing original, empirical social psychological research on specific topics in the field. We will concentrate on two content areas of
research: (1) stereotypes and prejudice, particularly as they touch on issues concerning the academic achievement of women and people of color, and on the role of self-esteem in
stereotyping and prejudice, and (2) interpersonal suspicion, including an examination of factors that might reduce suspicion in interracial or cross-cultural dyads or groups.
Students will research and critically analyze and integrate the relevant literatures concerning these topics, and will design and conduct original research to test empirically several
hypotheses that emerge from these literatures. We will examine a variety of types of research design and statistical techniques.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: a series of papers, written and oral reports of research.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and PSYC 242. Enrollment limit: 16. Preference given to Psychology majors.

MARCUS

PSYC 346(S) Environmental Psychology (Same as ENVI 346)
This is a course in social psychology as it pertains to the natural environment. We will consider how the environment influences aspects of human psychology (e.g., the psychological implications of humans’ disconnect with nature), as well as how human psychology influences the environment (e.g., why some people engage in environmentally
destructive behaviors despite holding pro-environmental attitudes). At the core of this course is an attempt to examine various ways in which research and theory in social
psychology can contribute insights to understanding (and encouraging) environmentally responsible behavior and sustainable practices, both here at Williams and globally.
Because human choice and behavior play such an important role in environmental problems, a consideration of human psychology may therefore be an important part of the
solution.
Format: empirical lab course. Requirements: a series of papers, two essay exams, written and oral reports of research.
Prerequisites: PSYC 242 recommended, PSYC 201, or a comparable course in statistics and research methodology, is also recommended. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16).

PSYC 348T(F) Is it the Thought that Counts? Examining Intentions and Outcomes in Intergroup Interaction (D)
Can something be racist if someone didn’t mean it? How do the intentions we bring to interactions line up with the outcomes of the interactions? When individuals enter intergroup interactions, they are likely to have a variety of goals. Some of these goals are straightforward, such as making a new friend or collaborating on an academic project, while
others may be more implicit, such as making a good impression or avoiding saying anything offensive. In this tutorial, we will examine how intentions and outcomes are used in

251

judgments of discrimination, how goals can make intergroup interaction more harmonious or more fraught, and how interaction goals can sometimes backfire and produce
unintended consequences. Each tutorial pair will design and execute an empirical project to examine the relationship between intentions and outcomes in intergroup interaction.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week; each week, students will either compose a position paper based on the
week’s readings, or respond to the position paper of their partner; empirical projects will be presented in a symposium format at the final meeting.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 and PSYC 242 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors.

intergroup interaction. We will discuss the current challenges of intergroup interaction, and the ways in which good intentions can sometimes backfire in these situations. We will
focus on interactions across specific group-based differences, such as race/ethnicity, sexuality, social class, and gender, and in specific settings, such as schools and workplaces.
All students will design and conduct an empirical research project. The course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by focusing on how group membership, individual
differences, and social power affect the experiences of both majority and minority group members in these interactions.

PSYC 350 Child Psychopathology
This course explores the rapidly evolving field of psychological disorders in childhood and adolescence. We will examine the intertwined effects of individual characteristics
(e.g., genetics, neurobiological factors), relationship processes (e.g., parenting, family functioning, peers), community settings (e.g., schools, neighborhoods), and the broader
cultural context (e.g., poverty, stigma, media). Using a developmental framework, we will examine the emergence and maintenance of specific psychological disorders, as well
as variations in how children cope with cataclysmic stressors (chronic illness, physical and sexual abuse). The goals of this course include (1) appreciation of the dynamic
interplay between biology and experience in the unfolding of psychopathology, (2) exploration of diagnostic criteria and phenomenology of specific disorders, and (3) exposure
to a wide range of research-based strategies for prevention and intervention.

SOCKOL
PSYC 355(S) Psychotherapy: Theory and Research (W)
Psychotherapy is a young, barely 100-year old psychological endeavor which attempts to promote change and healing through social interaction. How can it be that talking with a
psychotherapist can help people change— emotionally, cognitively, and/or behaviorally— and how exactly does it help people achieve relief from psychological disorders and
problems? In this course, we will study some of the key approaches to psychotherapy by examining the theories and scientific research that surround them, and considering
theory and research in juxtaposition. This will be accomplished by a close reading and critical analysis of primary source theoretical papers, the “raw data” (videotapes and
transcripts) of therapy sessions, case studies, and contemporary empirical research on the outcomes and change processes of psychotherapy. Students will learn how to evaluate
the efficacy claims of both standard and new therapies and how to evaluate claims about the mechanisms by which those therapies work. Current controversies in psychotherapy
and psychotherapy research will be addressed and debated as well.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two position papers of 5-6 pages and oral class presentations based on these, final term paper in the form of a grant
proposal outlining an important question for psychotherapy research, reviewing the extant literature, and proposing a study or studies to address these questions.
Prerequisites: PSYC 201 (Experimentation and Statistics), PSYC 252 (Psychological Disorders). Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to Psychology majors.

PSYC 372 Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning (Not offered 2013-2014)
This advanced seminar will give students an opportunity to connect theory to practice. Each student will have a teaching placement in a local school, and participate in both peer
and individual supervision. In addition, we will read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and research on the process of education.
What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of child development and teaching translate into everyday practices with students? Students will be encouraged to reflect
on and modify their own teaching practices as a result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we will discuss include: What is the relationship between educational goals and curriculum development? What is the relation between substance (knowledge, skills, content) and the interpersonal dynamic inherent in a classroom setting?
How do we assess teaching practices and the students’ learning? What does it take to be an educated person?

PUBLIC HEALTH
Chair, Associate Professor LOIS BANTA
Advisory Committee: Professors: DARROW**, D. GOLLIN*, C. JOHNSON, SHANKS, SHORE-SHEPPARD, ZIMMERBERG***. Associate Professors:
BANTA, GEHRING***,HANE**, KLINGENBERG, MUNEMO, WATSON**. Assistant Professors: KOHLER. Adjunct Associate Professor: HONDERICH.
Lecturer: GUTSCHOW, J. PEDRONI.
Public health seeks to understand, and also to protect and improve, health at the level of a community or population. Communities make decisions and allocate resources that,
intentionally or not, fundamentally shape human life. For example, great reductions in sickness and early death have come from social interventions with relatively low financial
cost, such as physically separating drinking water from sewage, or distributing aspirin, condoms, mosquito nets, vaccines or soap, or sharing new ideas about life’s possibilities.
The way a society is organized affects the way that social and scientific knowledge is distributed within it; access to that knowledge shapes health at the individual level. At its
heart, the study of public health focuses on questions about relationships between science and society, and between reality and possibility: what effective public health policy is
and how we can measure its effectiveness; what the relationship is, and ought to be, between research and policy; how we reconcile important moral and economic claims, or
balance other values that compete with maximizing health; what counts as disease, over time and among cultures; how we think about cause and responsibility; what constitutes a
healthy environment; how our fundamental beliefs determine our approaches to health decisions; and how such decisions ought to be made.

Requirements:
PHLH 150(F) Introduction to Public and Global Health (Same as Anthropology 105 and INTR 150)
All students wishing to pursue the Area of Concentration should take this course early in their careers. Students may petition the advisory committee to substitute a course taken
in a study-abroad program focused on global health, providing that the course is equivalent in scope. However, students who plan to take advantage of this option should have
taken at least two other courses from among the electives by the end of their sophomore year, and should recognize that those who lack a foundation in the core issues of the
field may find it more challenging to prepare their proposal for admission to the concentration.
Statistics
Statistical analysis is at the heart of the quantitative tools necessary to study the health of populations. One course in statistics from the list below is required of all concentrators.
Electives
Concentrators must take at least three electives, with at least two different prefixes, from the list below. Elective courses are grouped by category, but these clusters are not
meant to constrain students to a single ”track” within the program. Instead, each student is free to determine, with the guidance of an advisory committee member(s), a set of
electives that provides an intellectually coherent exploration of his/her particular areas of interest within the field of public health. In choosing electives, students should consider the balance of breadth versus depth that will allow them to gain theoretical and methodological sophistication in one or more areas. Students may not substitute an independent study for any of these electives.
Experiential Component
Because many public health challenges cannot be fully appreciated until one has hands-on experience with real communities and actual populations, each concentrator must
have at least one relevant field-based educational experience with a research component. This requirement may be met through participation in an approved study abroad
program (see below), one of the Winter study courses marked with an asterisk, a WS99 project, or a not-for-credit summer or academic-year internship. In every case, the
advisory committee must approve the project in advance. This experiential component will serve as a focal point for the student’s work in the capstone course.
Capstone Course
The capstone seminar provides concentrators with the opportunity to reflect upon and synthesize their experiential learning in the context of understanding gained from a
cohesive set of elective courses, and through the lens of a variety of intellectual and disciplinary frameworks. A second goal is to give concentrators experience working in a
multi-disciplinary team to address a real-world, and in many cases very daunting, public health problem. Students will spend the first part of the semester writing about and
sharing with their classmates their fieldwork experiences; these reflections will be framed by readings on health inequities, cultural perspectives and global practices. Through
these case studies, students will gain an appreciation for the complex web of structural, societal, and policy issues that define and constrain approaches to contemporary public
health crises. Readings for this portion of the course will be chosen by the faculty member to address a shared topic, to be agreed upon by the end of the spring semester of the
previous academic year between the instructor and students. In the second portion of the course, teams of students will identify a public or global health problem (akin to a
Gates Global Challenge), and, drawing jointly on the methods of their respective disciplines, will develop a comprehensive proposal to address this problem. Team projects
will be presented to and evaluated by a board of internal and/or external examiners, comprised of faculty members from Williams, alumni and other PH practitioners from the
surrounding region. The capstone course is required of all concentrators, but may be opened to other students with relevant experience at the discretion of the instructor and the
advisory committee, if space permits.
Written Proposal for the PH Portfolio
To be considered for admission to the Area of Concentration in Public Health, students must submit a written statement describing the portfolio of courses, study abroad, and
experiential learning component(s) they intend to pursue. In this proposal, candidates for the concentration should describe their intellectual goals, and if relevant, how these
relate to their professional goals. A fundamental purpose of the proposal requirement is to encourage the student to consider concretely how s/he will engage with socio-cultural, behavioral, policy, and/or biomedical aspects of population health. To this end, students should address whether a methodological or disciplinary emphasis ties their chosen
courses together, and how the intended experiential component will relate to this set of questions. This proposal is due by the time a student declares the concentration, typically
in the spring of the sophomore year, and should be prepared in consultation with a member of the advisory committee. Concentrators are required to revisit and update their
proposal prior to registration in the spring of the junior year, and to provide documentation of their internship experience both prospectively and retrospectively. The final
portfolio will typically include major papers written for electives within the concentration, and may serve as a resource for students to draw on during their capstone course.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships provide a crucial opportunity to engage with global health issues through field-based coursework and independent research projects.
The Public Health program in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will advise students on opportunities in these areas. In
particular, students may want to consider one of the several Global Health options offered through SIT. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad program
can be counted toward the three elective courses, with permission of the program coordinator.

Core Course
PHLH 150(F) Introduction to Public and Global Health (Same as Anthropology 105 and INTR 150)
Public health focuses on improving health at the level of individuals, communities, or populations. It seeks to understand both individual and collective behaviors that shape
health outcomes in the world today. This class introduces students to core concepts and methods within the fields of public and global health. It investigates the interrelationship
of individual and social choices with demographic and biological factors in producing health outcomes. We look at the pathology and epidemiology of the major diseases and
health disparities in the world today, focusing as much on health equity as on the social and cultural constructions of illness, disease, and health-seeking behaviors. We explore
several case studies to understand the contributing causes of and policy initiatives around the major crises in global health today including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and
maternal mortality. The course involves multiple disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, sociology, economics, biology, bioethics, and political science. By the end of
the semester, we will understand what creates effective public health policy for individuals as well as communities. How does one reconcile the competing moral, social, and
human rights claims in shaping health policies and practices at a variety of levels?
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon participation in class blog, class discussion, one presentation, and final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

Chair, Associate Professor JASON JOSEPHSON
Professors: BUELL*, DARROW**, DREYFUS. Associate Professor: JOSEPHSON. Assistant Professors: HIDALGO, ISRAEL, SHUCK. Lecturer:
GUTSCHOW. Bolin Fellow: NINH.
MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a phenomenon of
psychological, sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure
both coherence and variety. Beginning with the class of 2016, the major in Religion will consist of at least nine semester courses as follows:

Required sequence courses
Religion 200 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion
One 300-level seminar or tutorial
Religion 401 Senior seminar

Elective courses
Six electives at the 100, 200 or 300 level (with a maximum of one 100-level class to count towards major)
In addition, each major will select a specialization route in the major in conversation with and with the approval of the department. The specialization will consist of at
least four courses. There are two ways to meet this requirement. A major could fulfill the requirement by concentration in one of the College’s co-ordinate programs or
by designating four specialization courses that can be supported by the resources of the Religion department faculty and the College. In other words, these four courses
might be from among the six electives and one 300-level seminar or tutorial or might include additional coursework from other programs and departments (whether
cross-listed or not).
The major will culminate in a year-long senior project. The first semester will remain a seminar (REL 401) on a topic in the study of religion set by the faculty member in
consultation with incoming seniors. The spring semester will consist of participation in a research colloquium (not a course taken for credit). In this colloquium, each senior
major will present their individual research projects, begun in the senior seminar, drawing on their specializations and advised by members of the faculty.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon
(e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the department, to pursue a thesis
project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major
further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture
and the relationships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore remarkably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or
professions.
The department will work with students in the classes of 2014-2015 to adapt these new guidelines for the major. Beginning in spring 2012, students declaring Religion
as a major will identify an area of specialization and link it to their senior seminar final paper and be expected to present it in a spring colloquium during their senior
year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may
combine revised work done in other courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to two-thirds of the work in the
thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme or by a focus on a
particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for
honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that may be included in the thesis to the department in the spring of their junior year. Students must normally
have at least a 3.5 GPA in Religion to be considered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.

STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Religion Department encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance their education and gain international perspectives on
religious studies. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them cultural immersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. Many of our majors study in the Williams College Oxford Program, but our majors
also regularly pursue a semester or year-long study in other programs.

REL 101 Introduction to Religion (Not offered 2013-2014)
An examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensibility—employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of inquiry—the course offers a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and includes consideration of several cross-cultural types
of religious expression.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assessment will be based on brief essays, a more substantial midterm paper and final essay-based exercise.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-25).
REL 103 The Way of Power: A History of Occult Knowledge and Practices (Not offered 2013-2014)
Description: Since antiquity, certain individuals and groups have claimed privileged access to hidden sources of knowledge, which they maintained could only be revealed to the
initiated or enlightened. What is more, it was also often asserted that this knowledge conveyed various powers—from summoning good and evil spirits, transforming base metals
into gold, predicting the future, achieving bodily immortality, directly witnessing the face of God or even becoming a God. How does examining these claims alter our under-

255

standing of established religions? This course will trace the historical development of these practices and beliefs-known to scholars as “esotericism”—from antiquity to the
present. It will cover such topics as magic, alchemy, kabbalah, Gnosticism, hermeticism, Theosophy, tantrism, occultism, vodou, and spiritualism. Emphasizing close the reading
of the primary sources, we will explore the boundaries between religion, magic and science. We will discuss esotericism as the site for the European appropriation of the “Orient,”
the construction of discipline of religious studies, and even the origins of modern science.

REL 104(F) Religion Conflict and Cooperation
Violent conflicts throughout the world are animated by religious rhetoric, driven by religious actors, and sanctioned by religious authorities. At the same time, religious and
“interfaith” organizations are often prominent participants in peace advocacy and conflict resolution. What are the varieties of religious involvement in war and peace? What can
we learn about ”religion” from religious conflicts and cooperative initiatives? Does the modern nation-state increase the likelihood of religious conflict? Will 21st century globalization support more or less conflict and/or cooperation? We will investigate these questions through contemporary case studies including: conflicts between Jews and Muslims
in Israel/Palestine, Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka, and Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. We will also look at the religious militancy of Al Qaeda, the Lord’s
Resistance Army in Uganda, and other groups. And we will consider religious efforts to end these conflicts peacefully and delegitimize militant groups. In each case, we will see
how competition for control over what counts as “Judaism,” “Hinduism,” ”religion,” “religious,” and so forth is central to these conflicts and to the goals of those who seek to
resolve them. Along with primary and secondary sources related to each case study, we will read theoretical works by Mark Juergensmeyer, Samuel Huntington, Scott Appleby,
Bruce Lincoln, Peter van der Veer, Olivier Roy, Ananda Abeysekara, Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, and others.

REL 200(S) Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion
As recently at the 1960s, the most influential theorists of modernity were predicting that religion would eventually vanish, while theologians lamented what they called the
“Death of God.” But one has only to glance at today’s headlines to see that accounts of religion’s demise were premature. Indeed a basic knowledge of religion is indispensable to
understanding the current global moment as well as a range of fields from political science to English literature and history. To explore the meaning of religion, this course will
introduce the debates around which the discipline of religious studies has been constituted. It will familiarize students with the discipline’s most significant theorists (both foundational and contemporary) and trace their multidisciplinary—philosophical, sociological, anthropological, and psychological—modes of inquiry. At stake are questions such as:
How does one go about studying religion? Is “religion” even a cultural universal? Or is it merely the byproduct of the European Enlightenment? What is religion’s relationship to
God? to science? to society? to secularism? to colonialism? to ethics? to politics? to violence? to sex? to freedom? Has religion changed fundamentally in modernity? And if so,
what is its future?
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, short weekly writing assignments, a 5-page midterm paper, and a 10- to 15-page final paper.

The Hebrew Bible is perhaps the single most influential work in the history of Western philosophy, literature, and art. But the overwhelming presence of the text in nearly every
aspect of modern culture often obscures the sheer brilliance of its narrative technique as well as the complex interplay between law, history, prophecy, and poetry. This course
offers a comprehensive introduction to the literary, historical, and theological aspects of the Hebrew Bible with an eye towards developing a sophisticated understanding of the
text in its ancient context. Through the close reading of substantial portions of the Hebrew Scripture in translation and the application of various modern critical approaches to
culture and literature, students will explore fundamental questions about the social, ritual, and philosophical history of ancient Israel, as well as the fundamental power of storytelling that has resonated across two millennia.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short written assignments, and two to three longer papers.

REL 202 Moses: Stranger in a Strange Land (Same as COMP 214 and JWST 202) (Not offered 2013-2014)
As chieftain, priest, prophet, and lawgiver all in one, Moses occupies the central place in the history of Israelite and Jewish leaders. However, he is a somewhat unlikely candidate
for such an important role. He is God’s chosen leader among the enslaved Israelites, but he is raised as an Egyptian prince. He is a spokesman for his people, but he is slow of
speech. He is the lawgiver and first judge of his nation, yet he is quick-tempered and impatient. The story of the most revered figure in the Jewish tradition, who nevertheless
remains an outsider to the very end, has fascinated commentators and inspired countless artistic and literary interpretations. This course will engage in a close study of the figure
of Moses by examining the biblical narrative of his life and career from Exodus through Deuteronomy with an eye towards understanding the complex and often contradictory
portrait of this self-described “stranger in a strange land.” We will also examine some of the ancient legendary and folkloric accounts about Moses, as well as philosophical and
allegorical treatments in Hellenistic Jewish, early Christian, and Muslim biographies. We will then proceed to investigate key modern reconfigurations and critiques of Moses in
several genres, which may include renaissance visual depictions, literary works by Sigmund Freud, George Eliot, Thomas Mann, and Zora Neale Hurston, and even musical and
cinematic renditions. All readings are in translation.

What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew Bible? How does the modern Reform movement link itself to the laws
of the rabbinic sages? Are there consistent values and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the Jewish tradition have enabled its
elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the traditions of Jewish thought and practice through the ages, this course will take up these questions. Though
the course’s method of progression will be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel’s beginnings and culminating with contemporary debates over Jewish
identity, we will additionally emphasize the strong ties between methods of Jewish thought and practices and the surrounding cultural environments in which they developed. We
will approach the tradition not only with historical concerns, but with literary and philosophical aims as well. We will analyze the interpretive strategies, theological presuppositions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its continuities and its ruptures. Finally, we will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the
category of religion, considering as well the other categories that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and Jewishness, such as nation, people, race and ethnicity, and the
motivations behind such designations. Texts will include the Hebrew Bible, Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusalem; Hertzberg
(ed), The Zionist Idea; Levi, Survival in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a course packet.

REL 205(S) Ancient Wisdom Literature (Same as CLAS 205, COMP 217 and JWST 205)
The Biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job are often grouped together under the Hebrew category of hokhmah, ‘wisdom.’ Although these books are very different in
content, they can all be interpreted as meditations on ethical and practical philosophy. In this way, they represent the Hebrew Bible’s canonical embrace of a widespread Near
Eastern literary phenomenon. From the instructional literature of Egypt and Mesopotamia to Greek didactic poetry and fables, ancient Mediterranean cultures offer a wide range
of texts that engage the issues of personal behavior, leadership, and justice. Starting with the central wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible and moving through relevant material
from the Apocrypha, New Testament, and the Egyptian and Babylonian traditions, this course will examine the literature of wisdom throughout the ancient world with an eye
toward understanding its various social, political, and philosophical contexts. We will then consider the Greek wisdom tradition in such texts as Hesiod’s Works and Days,
Aesop’s fables, and fragments from the pre-Socratic philosophers. Finally, we will explore the influence of these ancient sources on later expressions of wisdom in medieval

256

The Book of Job has often been described as the most philosophical book of the Hebrew Bible. The story of one man’s struggle to understand the cause of his suffering and his
relationship to God represents the finest flowering of the Near Eastern wisdom literature tradition. Through its exploration of fundamental issues concerning human suffering,
fate and divinity, and the nature of philosophical self-examination, Job has served as a touchstone for the entire history of existential literature. At the same time, the sheer poetic
force of the story has inspired some of the greatest artistic and literary meditations in the Western tradition. This course will engage in a close reading of the Book of Job in its full
cultural, religious, and historical context with special attention to its literary, philosophical, and psychological dimensions. We will then proceed to investigate key modern works
in several genres that involve Joban motifs, themes, and text both explicitly and implicitly. These texts will include Franz Kafka’s The Trial, Archibald MacLeish’s J.B., Robert
Frost’s “Masque of Reason,” Carl Jung’s Answer to Job, and William Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of Job. All readings are in translation.

How long did Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden? What was the mark of Cain? Why did Enoch not die? Who was Noah’s wife? How did Giants survive the Flood? These
are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of Genesis present a
tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful
economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a
close reading of ancient non-canonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo,
and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive
body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to several continuations of these variant traditions in medieval and early modern literature, with particular attention to the extensive material on the figures of Cain and Noah. All readings are in translation.

The objective of this course is to broadly examine the meanings and significance of different forms of religious practices and beliefs among Asian Americans. It treads across
many layers of diversity - from religious traditions to ethnicity, place, and time - and we will draw upon theoretically-based historical, anthropological and sociological perspectives to understand their complexities, convergences, and (dis)continuities. Thus, although the course is focused on the religious life of Asians in the U.S., it also grounds and
connects this topic to Asia, societal phenomenon that shaped this society and its people, and contemporary global manifestations such as migration and diasporization. Books will

the fact that most religions in North America either did not emerge from European sources, or have existed long before the arrival of Europeans. Indeed, many religions have
grown out of the American soil during the past several centuries-what some would call the product of religious “cross-fertilization,” and what others would deem as religious and
cultural thievery, i.e. colonialism. This course follows a modified historical trajectory, one that strives to allow the voices of forgotten “others” to speak, bringing questions of

This course explores contemporary North America religions from a historical, sociological, and philosophical perspective. We will examine the historical and contemporary
experiences of America’s ever-expanding religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from older, Protestant-informed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of the ever-expanding variety of new religions in North America, challenging students to engage the numerous
cultural, philosophical, and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions. New religions often highlight cultural anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies, responses to new technologies, changing gender roles, globalization, etc. The study of new religions becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of
contemporary American culture and its underlying tensions. For example, the Raëlian Movement claims to have cloned the first human. Wicca, on the other hand, offers critiques
of environmental depredation and traditional gender roles. In sum, we will explore the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary issues, and
outline the possible forms new and emerging religions may assume in the coming years. This course will also have a website dedicated to the exploration of new religions,
providing links to interesting sites, basic resources, and student essays/projects.

and the lands they inhabit? How do the dynamics of utopia and utopianism impact different peoples as they have created, participated in, been excluded from, and lived under the
governments and cultures of the Western hemisphere and the United States of America in particular? This course considers the relationship between the utopian imaginations and
the imaginations of the lands and peoples in the Western hemisphere. We will spend some time studying utopian theory, ancient proto-utopias, and utopias in Latin America,
though our main focus will be particular examples of utopianism in the U.S.A. While the U.S.A. is the main focus of the class, students are encouraged to pursue and bring to

In this course we examine some of the myriad ways that Christian biblical narratives have appeared in certain movies. What are the overt and subtle ways that these films seek to
interpret and employ biblical texts? Why do they draw upon the texts they do and read them as they read them? What can cinematic interpretations of biblical texts reveal to us
about how these texts are used in broader U.S. culture? How does an awareness of this scriptural dimension in a work of ”popular culture” affect our interpretation of both the
film and the scriptural text’s meanings? How do varying interpretations of biblical texts help us to understand cinematic meaning? By assuming that we can read both biblical
texts and films in multiple and contradictory ways, this class can use film as the occasion for interpreting, analyzing, and debating the meanings, cultural functions, and affective
responses generated by biblical narratives in film. Finally, this course asks us to analyze how movies may interpret certain biblical texts in order to crystallize and reflect certain
political, economic, ethnic, racial, sexual, and social parameters of U.S. cultures. Attention to the biblical imagination of U.S. cinema and the cinematic imagination of biblical
texts will necessitate interdisciplinary study of text and representation and a concern with the implications of ways in which we read texts and films. While this course will read
selected biblical and extra-canonical texts, including selections from canonical and non-canonical gospels, the letters of Paul, and the book of Revelation, our foci will be on the
way that movies (and the people who make them and watch them) seek to make meaning out of and with reference to these biblical texts.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation to be based upon participation, short writing exercises (including three 1-page film analyses and three 1-page text analyses), one 3-page

One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur’an is more conscious of itself as text and the work of interpretation that is part of the life of a text. Because it is
God’s most important sign (and also because it is relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur’anic recitation is one of the supreme Islamic performing arts.
Nevertheless it is primarily as a text that the Qur’an exists in itself and in the minds of Muslims. The text of the Qur’an will thus be the focus of this course, reading it extensively,
intensively and repeatedly throughout the semester. We will attend to the structure and variety of styles and topics in the text and to the Qur’an’s understanding of itself in relation
to other forms of literary expression. We will place the form and content in the context of seventh century c.e. Arab society and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that
provides one crucial framework to the text. Through the lens of tafsir, Qur’anic commentary, we will also use the text to give an initial survey of some of the main theological,
philosophical, mystical and legal developments in the Islamic tradition. Finally we will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims, including the
development of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least one will have a revision process). Students able to read the Arabic text may

Both Muslim and non-Muslim historians usually see the rise of Islam in the seventh century C.E. as a total break with the past. This course will challenge that assumption by
placing the rise of Islam in the context of the history of late antiquity (c. 250-700 C.E.). The first portion of the course will examine the impact of Judeo-Christian monotheism
in the ancient world, the rise of confessional empires, articulation of new ideas about holiness and its relation to sexuality and the transformations undergone by Judaism,
Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism. We shall examine the conversation of these traditions with classical paganism and philosophy, the internal struggle within
traditions to define rules of interpretation, the impact of ascetic, iconoclastic and apocalyptic ideas and, finally, polemics among the traditions. We will then examine the career
of Muhammad (PBUH) in the context of Arabia, the spread of the Islamic empire into Christian and Iranian worlds,!
the impact of apocalyptic expectations, the fixation of religious decision making within the tradition, the process of conversion, the encounter with the Late Antique heritage
and religious diversity within the commonwealth of Islam. The course will end with the end of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258.

REL 232 The Texting of the Divine: Language and Imagination in Islamic Thought (Same as ARAB 232) (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
This course will be an introduction to Islamic intellectual history with a focus on the themes of God’s speech, the relation of reason and revelation, and the vision of a good and
just society. The course will begin with a survey of the legacy of Neoplatonic thought in the early Islamic period and the interreligious polemic of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians,
philosophers and Muslims. Out of this arose two separated movements in Islam: theology (kalam) and philosophy. In the first portion of the course we will trace the rise of the
Mu’tazila movement, their views on ‘divine speech’ and the Asharite and Maturidi response. We will then turn to the key figures of the classical Islamic tradition, al-Farabi, Ibn
Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn ’ufayl. In the final portion we will examine the rise of Islamic mystical thought (Sufism) and the complicated interrelations of that
rich movement with theology and philosophy in the figures of al-Ghazali, Suhrawardi, Ibn ’Arabi, Mulla Sadra and finally Muhammad Iqbal, “the father of Pakistan.”

REL 234 Shi’ism Ascendant? (Same as ARAB 234) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will be a survey of Islamic history from the Shi’ite perspective or better perspectives. The purpose is to provide a survey of issues in Islamic social and intellectual
history from the Shi’ite margin. On that margin, Shi’ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectuals (assuming the latter are not among the former) and
functioned in Islam to provide a vocabulary of revolution, a highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi’ite conflicts and raise fears of Shi’ite ascendancy. But sectarian conflict is, in
fact, the exception rather than the rule in Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi’a have in most places been separated or lived relatively peacefully together where they intermixed. This is the fourth time in Islamic history when the specter of an ascendant Shi’ism has occupied the Muslim community. This course will compare the three earlier
putative episodes of Shi’ite ascendancy in the eighth (in Iraq), tenth (in Egypt) and sixteenth centuries C.E. (in Iran) and set these in conversation with contemporary developments. We will focus on the role of early Shi’ism as the vocabulary of an alternative vision of the legitimacy of the Islamic state, the ideas of the imamate and martyrdom, the
emergence of Isma’ili and Twelver versions of Shi’ism, the conversion of Safavid Iran to Shi’ism, ecumencial efforts in the mid twentieth century, the Iranian revolution of 1979
and after.

REL 237(F) Islam, Pluralism, and the Religious Order
In recent years, Islam has become a major topic in the media, in political rhetoric, among intellectual communities, and among ordinary citizens in the Western world. A
recurring refrain in these discussions is the question of the position of Islam and Muslims vis–Ã –vis other religious and secular traditions in a pluralistic world. In this course,
we will situate this discourse as the product of a particular set of circumstances and an end result of particular historical and contemporary discourses that have portrayed Islam
and Muslims as the West’s “Other”. It is only when this perception of Islam as the other has been established that we can understand the self–perception of Muslims and the
Islamic tradition and it is only when we understand this ”self” that we can fruitfully understand how that tradition has perceived its own “others”. This course will examine the
historical and theological interface between Islamic and other religious traditions and between Muslims and religious others. We will look at: 1) the Qurâ’an, focusing on
verses that deal with questions of religious diversity and otherness, and their multiple interpretations; 2) the concept of prophecy and the particular example of Muhammad in
relation to religious others; 3) how the different schools of Islamic thought and practice– in scriptural exegesis, jurisprudence, philosophy, theology, and mysticism– have used
their specific methodologies to theorize religious difference; 4) how Muslims have theologically situated and culturally interacted with other religious traditions, specifically
Christianity, Judaism, Hindu traditions, Buddhism, and the Chinese religions; 5) how new discourses on religious diversity that articulate new modes of hermeneutics in
relation to the Qurâ’an and the Islamic tradition are being developed in the contemporary period by Muslim intellectuals and scholars and how they relate to global issues of
identity, otherness, and pluralism.

Sultanate through the Mughal Empire, British colonialism, to the present nation–states of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, South Asian Muslims have developed intellectual,
religious, and cultural traditions that have both been locally rooted and part of the broader Islamic world. In this course, we will survey diverse Muslim theological, philosophical, religious, juridical, literary, artistic, political, and spiritual traditions across the different regions of South Asia and in different temporal contexts, with a view to understanding how the broader Islamic tradition becomes embedded in particular cultural contexts. We will look at both Sunni and Shiâ’i, mainstream Twelver and Ismaâ’ili,
scholarly and popular traditions. Particular attention will be paid to Sufism, the Islamic mystical tradition, and the major role it played in Muslim life in South Asia. One theme
of the course will be the multifaceted encounters of Muslims with Indian religious traditions: we will explore Muslim narratives on Indian religions, mutual encounters

In this course, we follow the conversation among Indian philosophers concerning the self and the nature of consciousness. We start with some of the Hindu views about the self
and the mind and consider their ethical implications. We then consider a range of Buddhist critiques of these views, focusing more particularly on the Madhyamaka philosophy,
which radicalizes the critique of the self into a global anti-realist and skeptical stance. We also examine the Yogacara school, which offers a process view of reality focusing on the
analysis of experience. We conclude by considering some of the later Hindu holistic views of the self as responses to the Buddhist critique. In this way we come to realize that far
from being the irrational foil of “the West,” Indian tradition is a rich resource for thinking through some of the central ideas that have challenged philosophers in both traditions.

Often depicted as Shangrila, a mythical and ideal country, Tibet has had the dubious privilege of being a focus of Western fantasies. One cannot but wonder about the motives and
sources of this mythology. Although this course examines these representations, its main focus is an immersion in the cultural and historical aspects of Tibetan civilization, which
give students the tools with which to understand Tibetan culture from the inside. As such this course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative. We first consider the early history
of Tibet, the introduction of Buddhism, the relations between Buddhism and the indigenous religion, and some of the stages in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. We also
examine the historical developments that led to the development of the institutions (such as the Dalai-Lama) unique to Tibet and some of the aspects of the culture that these
institutions helped to create (such as gender roles, family structure and social stratification). Finally, we consider the more recent tragic events and examine the profound transformations that they have brought. Throughout the course, we consider the central role of the complex interaction between Buddhism and politics in Tibetan history, both in the
pre-modern period and in more recent times, when the Tibetan people have faced the challenge of how to use their institutions and culture to resist oppression. In this way, we get
a footing in the Tibetan world, and the indispensable assessment of Western representations of Tibet becomes not just an exercise in self-reflection but also a gate to a better
understanding of a remarkable but tragically threatened civilization. This course, which explores in depth the Tibetan cultural and the tragic cross-cultural misunderstanding that
threaten its integrity, is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.

India is a nation based on difference whose multiple and fragmenting identities are often framed as unified oppositions: Hindu/Muslim, Rich/Poor, Secular/Religious, Male/Female. This course will deconstruct the media’s popular representations of these and other identities in order to complicate the notion of a diverse Indian nation. It will highlight the
range of identities and social practices among India’s booming population that have produced critical axes of differentiation such as gender, caste, ethnicity, and religious sect. It
begins by considering how the colonial principle of “divide and rule” provides an object lesson in the ways that difference can be used to sustain both social hierarchy and
political rule. It describes how this logic of difference produced the tragedy of Partition and its legacy for the operation of gender and religion on the subcontinent. We critically
examine the class and religious divisions that led to the birth of three nations—India, Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh—and the particular logic of communalism and
religious violence in modern India. Throughout, the course attends to the subjective experience of being Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh, untouchable or upper caste, as well as male or
female as a way of understanding the way that difference shapes individual agency and lives across India. It seeks to empathize or at least understand the perspective of both
victims and perpetrators of communal and gendered forms of violence in India today. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by theorizing the ways in which
difference has been used to effect profound historical, social, and individual changes in the Indian subcontinent.

then examines the South Asian discourses linking body with nation, population, or purity. It explores a South Asian sociology of the body that occasions solidarity as well as
social suffering and structural violence. Along the way, it looks at a diverse set of practices that count or control bodies to produce social cohesion including yoga, sex selection,
family planning, monasticism, and fundamentalism. The body emerges as a lens through which to view the production of a politics of identity as much as fragmentation or social
hierarchy.

In East Asian cultures, as in the United States, popular conceptions of morality typically take their shape, not from explicit rules, but from moral paragons—stylized figures that
are said to embody a distinctive cluster of virtues. For example, American Christians invoke not only Jesus, but also a pantheon of “secular saints” as diverse as Martin Luther
King Jr. and General Patton, George Washington and Cesar Chavez. This course will explore the cultural functions of moral paragons and philosophies of virtue in East Asia by
introducing students to examples from Chinese and Japanese history, ranging from Confucian articulations of the ideal scholar-bureaucrat to Buddhist conceptions of the Bodhisattva to Taoist immortals. It will also address the history of ethical thought in East Asia, focusing particular attention on conceptions of “Virtue Ethics.” This approach has come
to be seen by some contemporary analytic philosophers as a way out of the impasse produced by ethical relativism and the loss of theological rationales for moral action.
Readings will include Euro-American philosophers such as Nietzsche and MacIntyre as well as primary texts in translation by Chuang-tzu, Confucius, Shantideva and others.

have an image of Zen Buddhism that is disconnected from anything actually practiced in East Asia. This course offers a corrective to this image by familiarizing students with

We then consider the transformations that Buddhism is undergoing in contemporary Thai society, examining the changing role of monks and laity, the complexities of gender dynamic, the resurgence of
the nun order, the rise of Buddhist social activism and the development of new Buddhist social philosophies. We ask questions such as: How can Buddhism adapt to modernity?
What are the transformations involved in this process? What is the role of Buddhism in the new consumerist culture, which is taking over East Asia? Should Buddhist traditions
take advantage of the opportunities of this new culture or should they adopt a critical stance toward its values? And if so, how can it contribute to the transformative movements

This course looks at how gender has shaped Buddhism as well as how Buddhism has shaped gender. Most generally, it considers the myriad ways that Buddhist soteriology and
practice produce the very gender differences they purport to overcome. How have the Buddha and his far-flung disciples institutionalized gender differences in spite of their
putative goal of transcending duality? We examine the varying experiences of women and men in Buddhist societies and literatures as a lens by which to analyze the pervasive
operation of social and gender hierarchies. Last but not least, we discuss how well feminist and American revisions of Buddhism have transformed gender and other forms of
difference. Our analysis revolves around several interdependent themes. (1) How do female and male bodies become the subject of a specific set of Buddhist gazes? What does
Buddhist discourse say about the possibility of gaining enlightenment in the female body? (2) How do gender divisions reflect deeper social divisions such as class and race in
Buddhist discourse? (3) How have feminist deconstructions of Buddhism transformed gender and social hierarchies in the contemporary world? This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by seeking to theorize the ways that Buddhism has produced and reinscribed gender differences and social hierarchies.

The figure of Abraham in the Hebrew scriptures is interesting for at least two reasons: he comes first and seems more universal rather than particular. He first received the
covenant and the promise of the land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people and the Arabs and the significance of that
wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the work of Paul and in the Qur’an where Muhammad identified with Abraham as the prototypical and non-sectarian
monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multidisciplinary reading of the Jewish, Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our
task is not to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his continuing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim
conflict and cooperation. We will begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis material on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idolatry and monotheism, the covenant and
circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and sons, and primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in the figure of
Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore the view of Abraham in the classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging
Rabbinic Judaism and the development of Abraham’s specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur’an and later Islamic
traditions. We will conclude with an examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently contested site on the West Bank where we will consider the
current religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and Muslims. The purpose of this tutorial is to read closely a variety of primary religious texts and to explore the
variety of tools available for the reading of those texts.

CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL INQUIRY
REL 281(S) Religion and Science
In the last few years the deniers of religion such as Dennett and Dawkins have forcefully argued that recent scientific developments show the degree to which religion is irrelevant
to a modern understanding of what it means to be human. Atran and Boyer have made a similar case, arguing that recent progresses in our understanding of human cognition
demonstrate that religion is a purely natural phenomenon that has little if any value for human development. Theologians such as Haught and Polkinghorne have rejected these
views, arguing that a proper understanding of scientific developments such as evolution and quantum mechanics suggests religiously relevant views of the universe and our place
therein. This course considers these competing perspectives while offering critical reflections on the views and categories involved in these controversies. We also examine the
works of reflective naturalists such as Bellah and Herrstein, who argue that far from showing the irrelevance of religious ideas and practices, the new mind and life sciences
suggest a much more nuanced view according to which religion is both grounded in the natural world and central to the development of human culture. Hence, it cannot be easily
discounted as irrelevant to a scientifically informed understanding of what it means to be human.

Curse for sin, opposite of fun, or curiously peripheral, as in the now conventional career advice, “Do what you love and the money will follow,” work has generally gotten short
shrift, at least by the male authors with soft hands one usually reads in college. This course will examine shifting attitudes and approaches to human labor in the history of western
thought. We will begin with a multifaceted consideration of why we work and the ways in which approaches to human labor intertwined with reflections on human inequality,
especially slavery and its justification, and the identification between poverty and the resistance to hard work. With the abolition of slavery and consequent arrival of modernity,
two trends are strikingly added to the traditional discourses on work: the workplace as the public site for the achievement of justice, e.g., a living wage, workplace safety and
equality of opportunity; and the articulation of individual identity and worth in the context of work, e.g., notions of profession, career and status.
The legacy of both those trends is still very much with us, but the twentieth century dislodged the focus on humans as laborers in favor of a view of them as consumers. That is in
part a consequence of the continuing shift from a production to a service economy, but also is intimately connected with the fortunately incomplete licensing of desire and leisure
that are becoming the hallmark of both our current consumer economy and workplace. These competing issues leave us with the central split in American society between the
slightly larger portion of Americans who say they ’get a sense of identity from their jobs’ and the remaining significant minority who describe their jobs as ’just what they do for a
living.’ This course will explore some of the reasons for this fundamental cleavage. In addition to readings in the classics of Western thought including the Bible, Hesiod, Plato,
Aristotle, St. Augustine, Hobbes, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Weber, we shall explore contemporary portrayals of work and workplaces in
literature and film and conclude with contemporary authors including Svendsen, Muirhead, Florida, Gini, Lindsay, Sennett.

REL 285T Haunted: Ghosts in the Study of Religion (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Haunting offers a powerful way to speak about forces that affect us profoundly while remaining invisible or elusive. “What is it that holds sway over us like an unconditional
prescription? The distance between us and that which commands our moves-or their opposite, our immobility-approaches us: it is a distance that closes in on you at times, it
announces a proximity closer than any intimacy or familiarity you have ever known” (Avital Ronell, Dictations: On Haunted Writing [1986] xvi-xvii). The figure of the ghost has
been developed by those seeking to grapple with the ongoing effects of modern slavery, colonialism, state-sponsored terrorism, the holocaust, and personal trauma and loss.
Building upon the insights about memory, history, and identity that haunting has been used to address, this course will challenge you to explore the study of religion by way of its
“seething absences.” We shall ask how the study of religion has endeavored to address loss, trauma, and its persistent effects, what “holds sway” over various approaches to the
study of religion, as well as how “religion” constitutes its own ghostly presence, haunting other domains.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or respond to their partner’s paper. Each student will write and present two
1-page papers, five 5-page papers, and five oral critiques (based on written notes) of their partner’s paper. Students will revise two papers.

REL 286 Shopping: Desire, Compulsion and Consumption (Not offered 2013-2014)
If the workplace was the essential site of modernity, then the shopping mall is the quintessential site of postmodernity; the place where consumption trumps production and, it has
been argued, our only remaining public space. This course will focus on the experience of shopping, focusing on three themes. First we will explore the manufacturing of desire
on which consumption must depend. We will critique the tired critiques of advertising and explore in more depth the neurotic and erotic dimensions of the creation of desire for
objects. We will then turn to some comparative and historical analysis contrasting the experience of shopping in traditional bazaars and contemporary malls, as well as exploring
the history of consumerism from the eighteenth century through the current phenomena of globalization. Finally, we will explore the place of shopping in our collective imaginations, attending especially to the relation between the gendering of the shopping experience and expressions of contempt and outrage toward consumerism, with a special focus
on the discourse on Christmas in American society.

REL 287 The Dynamics of Globalization: Society, Religion and the Environment (Same as ENVI 287) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course offers a theoretical reflection on the social, cultural and environmental dynamics of globalization and their consequences for the nature and place of religion. Rather
than argue for or against globalization, we examine the nature of this new configuration and its relation to (post)modernity, asking questions such as: What are the cultural and
social dynamics of globalization? What are the effects on the nature of the state and the political practices that take place in the global world? What are its environmental
consequences? We then shift to examining the role of culture in general and religion in particular, arguing that its renewed relevance is a function of the socio-cultural transformations that globalization brings about, particularly the loss of community and the atomization of individuals in an ever more inter-connected world. In this way, we come to
understand some of the dominant features of the global age, the role of cultural differences and the growing concern for questions of meaning and personal identity. We conclude
by examining some of the perspectives created by the new religious expressions that attempt to respond to this situation, from personal spiritual quests as manifested in interest in
Buddhism, ecology or mountain climbing, to various forms of fundamentalism, such as Evangelicalism, the fastest growing religious movement in the Americas, and the most
radical forms of Islamicism. Reading list: Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity; Castells, The Rise of the Network Society; Bauman, Globalization; Kivisto, Multiculturalism

REL 288(F) Embodiment and Consciousness: A Cross-Cultural Exploration (Same as PHIL 288)
This course examines some of the central questions raised by the study of the consciousness: the place of intentionality, the role of emotions, the relation with the body, the nature
of subjectivity, the scope of reflexivity, the nature of perceptual presence, etc. In confronting these difficult questions, we do not proceed purely theoretically but consider the
contributions of various observation-based traditions, from Buddhist psychology and meditative practices to phenomenology to neurosciences. We begin by examining some of
the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as a selfless stream of consciousness, its examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the
relation between cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to observe the mind and raise questions concerning the place of its study in the
mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the views of James, Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the mind
and the relation between consciousness, reflexivity and the body. In this way, we develop a rich array of analytical tools and observational practices to further our understanding
of the mind. But we also question the value of these tools based on first person approaches by relating them to the third person studies of the mind. In this way, we come to
appreciate the importance of considering the biology on which mental processes are based and the light that this approach throws on the nature of consciousness. We conclude by
considering the relation between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on the concept of the embodied mind as a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular practice of meditation, a class presentation, a short essay (6p) and a long final research paper (15 p.).

From Heaven to Hell, Valhalla to Hades, the Fields of Aaru to the Land of Yellow Springs, all cultures have generated images of other worlds that lie beyond death. By considering examples from a range of different cultures, this tutorial will guide students on an exploration of the topographies of these shadow-lands. In an effort to map the continuities
and discontinuities between these visions of the hereafter, we will consider them as reflections of existing social hierarchies, examining their underlying assumptions about
punishment and redemption, family, and ethics. Along the way, we will discuss culturally specific notions of death and mourning, attitudes towards the bodies of the dead, and
controversies about the nature of the soul. Texts will include selections from primary works in translation, such as Virgil’s Aeneid, Dante’s Inferno, and The Tibetan Book of the
Dead, as well as selections from secondary literature, including Teiser’s The Scripture on the Ten Kings, Gauchet’s The Disenchantment of the World, and Bremmer’s The Rise

Is there a distinctive “play” element in human culture? If so, what should count as play? Some likely candidates may be: joking, games, festivals, fantasy, and leisure. What about
the activities that we usually describe as “religious”? In this course we will investigate the relationship between religion and play. We will read from theorists in a wide variety of
disciplines who have written about play: philosophers, sociologists, animal psychologists, anthropologists, and others. But we will pay particular attention to overlap in the study
of play and the study of religion. We will ask, for instance: what is the play element in ritual, myth, and the devotional interpretation of texts? Is there something necessarily
playful about the academic study of religion itself? Once we have investigated the relationship between religion and play, we will then consider the significance of this relationship for political thinking about religion. Perhaps we should respect religious diversity out of respect for the variety of ways that people want to play? How might a deeper
understanding of play help us to address ongoing religious conflicts? We will read from Johan Huizinga, Brian Sutton-Smith, Gordon Burghardt, Victor Turner, Donald Winnicott, Bernard Suits, Sam Gill, Robert Bellah, Wendy Doniger, Friedrich Schiller, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jacques Derrida, and others.

How might one perform a philosophical study of history? How do ideas (including philosophical, artistic and religious movements) advance over time? What makes something
“thinkable” in one era, but inconceivable in another? What contemporary intellectual foundations rest on false universals?
This course will address these questions and provide students with methods for exploring the historical dimension of religion. It will focus on two approaches to the philosophy of
history inspired by Kant. One school (Hegel, Marx) has focused on tracing dialectical formations as the background against which all history unfolds. Another school (Foucault,
Agamben) performs “philosophical archeology,” which Foucault described as “the history of that which renders necessary a certain form of thought.”
This course will introduce students to these intertwined bodies of theory, which promise to do nothing less than expose bare the very foundations of knowledge and transform the
study of history from the stringing together of events into a philosophical enterprise. Thinkers to be considered may include: Kant, Hegel, Marx, Engels, Nietzsche, Foucault,
Agamben, and Jameson.

REL 304 From Hermeneutics to Post-Coloniality and Beyond (Same as COMP 344 and ENGL 386) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course explores and critiques some of the resources offered by “Theory” for making sense of our contemporary situation, focusing on the nature of interpretation and its role
in the construction of the self in a global world. We start with Gadamer’s hermeneutics, which offers a classical formulation of the philosophy of liberal arts education, stressing
the importance of questioning one’s prejudices. Although this approach offers important resources for understanding ourselves in a world of cultural differences, it also has
limitations, which we explore through the works of Derrida, Foucault and Said. In this way, we question some of the notions central to understanding ourselves such as identity
and difference, suggesting some of the difficulties in the ever more important yet problematic project of knowing oneself. We also suggest that representation is not innocent but
always implicated in the world of power and its complexities, particularly within the colonial and postcolonial contexts explored by Said. We conclude with a critique of the
constructivist paradigm central to this course done from the point of view of cognitive sciences and suggest that the future of “Theory” may well be in a dialogue with the
emerging mind sciences. This course, which theorizes the possibilities of cross-cultural understanding, is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.

REL 305 Foucault (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
Michel Foucault was first and foremost a scholar of power. His ironic “genealogies” of how the Enlightenment promised freedom but instead delivered intricate and perilous
technologies of control have inspired philosophers, intellectual historians, and even novelists. Yet for all of this Foucault is often thought of as having posited a helpless subject
trapped in an inescapable web. Worse, scholars such as Rosie Braidotti have seen this subject as a uniquely masculine maneuver-ignoring women’s struggles. This course will
consider Foucault and his own “mentors,” Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Kant, among others, as well as exploring such central questions as Foucault’s views on gender and sexuality. We will also examine whether Foucault was able—as he intended—to move beyond “resistance” in his later writings and help post-Enlightenment individuals engender a
more empowered sense of subjectivity.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon: active classroom engagement (students are expected to take a major role in class discussions as this is a seminar course), two

What does feminist theory have to offer the study of religion? How have participants in various religious traditions helped to produce and enact feminisms? Feminisms and
religion(s) have a long though often troubled history of interconnection. In this course, we shall explore a range of feminist and queer theoretical analyses that have either
emerged out of particular religious contexts or have been applied to the study of religious traditions and practices. We shall consider how conflicts within feminism—especially
those pertaining to issues of sexuality, gender, race, class, nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation—make a difference for the ways that religion is interpreted and practiced.
Format: seminar.

REL 307 Thinking Gods: Cognitive Theories of Religion (Not offered 2013-2014)
Although it is still in its infancy, the so-called “cognitive turn” has already become one of the most exciting contemporary developments in the study of religion. During the past
twenty years, scholars influenced by cognitive science have begun to formulate new models and challenge old assumptions about human religiosity and its relationship to the
mind. In so doing, they have articulated theories about the evolutionary origins of religious concepts, reassessed the role of memory and of counterintuitive explanations in the
perpetuation of religious ideas, and developed new concepts such as “theological incorrectness” and “systematic anthropomorphism.” By examining the cutting-edge work
produced by members of this movement on both sides of the Atlantic, this seminar for advanced students will trace the historical roots of the cognitive turn and introduce some of
its most important recent products. Authors to be considered include Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Feuerbach, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, D. Jason Slone, Pascal Boyer, Veikko Anttonen,

Few thinkers have been as controversial or as outspoken about religion as the nineteenth century German theorist/philologist Friedrich Nietzsche. His work was not understood
during his lifetime, or so he thought, and there are definitely controversies surrounding the way the writings of Nietzsche ought to be applied in the early twenty-first century. We
will see Nietzsche as a lonely curmudgeon who hated his rigid, Lutheran upbringing, as well as his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. But we will also see the many fruitful
dialogues created by his fractured personality and vitriolic books which, perhaps despite his intentions, speak to religion in both a destructive and constructive way, as well as to
later thinkers.

ways have “scriptures” informed how peoples imagine themselves and others? How did “scriptures” and race” inform each other in modern colonialisms and imperialisms? In
this course, we will examine the ways that “scriptures” have been employed in order to understand and develop notions of “race,” and we will examine how ideas about “race”
have informed the concept of “scriptures” as well as practices of scriptural interpretation. While this course will focus on the relationships between constructions of “race” in the

How do we experience and represent time, and what factors might account for both our experiences and our representations? What are some of the ways that people experience
and ritually mark the passing of time? What are some of the different ways that people have made sense of time and themselves in time? Especially for individuals and peoples
who have been denied certain self-representation and narratives of place, how do competing notions of time, history, space, and location get negotiated? In this course, drawing
from within the broad corpus of queer theory (including theorists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Elizabeth Freeman, J. Halberstam, and José Esteban Muñoz) we will examine some
non-linear, non-normative, and interruptive approaches to making sense of time, space-time, and self within time. On the one hand, we will consider theorists who specifically
question and challenge what José Esteban Muñoz dubs the “linearity of straight time,” and we will turn to a set of issues with regard to family and sexuality, especially critiques of
normative lifecycle events and rituals that have reconfigured experiences and representations of time and place. On the other hand, we will also work with queer theory as it
explores alternatives to normative conceptualizations of time and place that have already existed in the past. Hence we will look not only to queer theory as it reads more
contemporary negotiations of sexuality, identity, time, and space-time; we will also consider how some contemporary theorists have read previous historical examples.
Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week. Almost every week, one student from the pair will write a 5-page analysis of the week’s reading. The other
student will respond orally with a 2-page response to their partner’s paper. Pairs will also prepare a midterm synthesis, and students will revise two of their 5-page analytical

REL 327(S) Theory after Postmodernism (Same as COMP 327)
Since the 1970s much of the academy has labored under a particular form of linguistic skepticism (often called postmodernism or poststructuralism) that is directed at the
destruction of stable conceptions of subjectivity and meaning. It is often said that everything is a text and that all knowledge is power. But just as the typewriter has given way to
the computer and disco to dubsteb, as we exit postmodernity new philosophies are appearing on the conceptual horizon.
This course will layout this challenge to postmodernism by exploring the work of cutting edge theorists in French and American movements known as new materialism, speculative realism, and actor-network theory. Often drawing on work in ecology, feminism, science studies, neuroscience and complexity theory, these thinkers aim to reclaim knowledge of the real world, to suture the separation between the sciences and the humanities, and to overturn what they see as the dualism between matter (as dead or inert) and mind
(as the locus of life and agency). By so doing, they claim to empower the object-world and dethrone humanity from the center of philosophy. Thinkers to be considered may
include: Karen Barad, Jane Bennett, Bruno Latour, Catherine Malabou, Quentin Meillassoux and Bernard Stiegler.
While the relevance of these movements to the study of religion will be discussed, this course is intended for students of any major who wish to study critical, political, or
philosophical theory.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular participation and attendance, regular short writing assignments, 10- to 15-page final paper.

By the late 19th century, Jews across Europe were faced with an urgent political problem. Amidst bourgeoning national self-consciousness throughout the continent, despite the
liberatory promises of the Enlightenment, Jews remained a vulnerable, segregated, and stigmatized minority population. Jews had to decide where to pin their hopes. Should they
ally themselves with the liberals or the communists? Should they embrace nationalism or cosmopolitanism? Should they, perhaps, abandon Europe altogether and re-constitute
themselves elsewhere? If so, should they focus their efforts on relocation to the historical land of Israel? Or could they go anywhere? Wherever they might go, should they aspire
to build a modern Jewish nation-state, a semi-autonomous Jewish community, or some other arrangement? Should this coincide with the cultivation of a distinctively Jewish
modern language? If so, should it be Hebrew or Yiddish? In this course we will assess various answers to these questions proffered by Jewish political thinkers in the modern
period. We will pay particular attention to the construction of”Jews” and “Judaism” in these arguments. And we will ask persistently: what constitutes a“Jewish justification” for
a political claim in modern Jewish political theory? Coverage will include: Jewish liberalism, political Zionism, Yiddishist autonomism, messianic quietism, and other views. We

This course will explore the significance of knowledge, its sources, its production and its transmission in the Islamic tradition. We will begin with an in–depth examination of the
primary epistemologies, or modes of knowing, classically elaborated in the Islamic tradition, which were principally categorized into three: transmitted (or scholarly), intellectual
(or philosophical), and spiritual (or mystical). These were the roots of all the distinct disciplines that Muslims developed, each with its own methodology, such as Qurâ’anic
interpretation, Hadith studies, jurisprudence, dialectical theology, philosophy, and practical and theoretical Sufism (Islamic mysticism). We will closely examine how knowledge
was defined, derived, and produced in these disciplines and the myriad ways that Muslim scholars, philosophers, theologians, and mystics sought to understand God, the world,
humanity, and religion, through their lens. We will conclude with seeing how knowledge and its production have been transformed in the modern period, from the emergence of
Muslim modernism to various puritanical reformisms to the “democratization” and globalization of knowledge through modern means of communication, to various paths of
Muslim resistance to hegemony in the postcolonial world.

MAJOR—French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression through the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world.
Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 102 level. One of these courses must be the 400-level senior seminar during the student’s final year at the College.
Students entering the major program at the 200-level may, with the permission of the Department, choose as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History,
Philosophy, Comparative Literature or other subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students entering the major program at a very advanced level may, in
some cases and with the permission of the Department, include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based
on the above areas of literary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end of their sophomore year. This is
especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is
expected.

MAJOR—French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical,
social, and political heritage of France and the Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several departments and the
opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor during their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility
plan that articulates their projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least three courses in French language and/or literature above the French 102 level;
2) the senior seminar during the student’s final year at the College;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture,
history, society, and politics of France and the Francophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Romance Languages.
Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
4) at least two literature courses that are taught in French.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some
cases, and upon consultation with the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for example, when the thesis is
interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be
made to the focus and scope of the project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study
period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in French and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semester, students will
normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably
rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a departmental colloquium in French. The thesis will be promptly
discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent writing
more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring
term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.

THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In
addition, the student must take a proficiency test and achieve a score of “Advanced.” The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of April to all
students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior study of French, the course sequence will consist of RLFR 101-102, RLFR 103, RLFR 104, and three additional courses, with at least one of these at
the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. For students starting the sequence at RLFR 103, five additional courses must be taken, including at least three French courses at the
200-level or higher. For all students starting at the French 103 level or higher, two electives may be taken in other departments: one elective should be in French or Francophone
culture (art, literature, theatre, music) and the other in French or Francophone civilization (history, political science).
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.

PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102
level must take this test, regardless of their previous preparation.

STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American
study-in-France programs require applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) before they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Williams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and cultural experience
in a French-speaking environment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at the discretion of the Department: up to 4 major credits for a semester or full
year abroad. The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the student’s major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be
determined by review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty
members in French by the second semester of their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in France may well be
beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education, students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by the Department.
Please consult a faculty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department does not administer proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student
who has not completed a French course at Williams.

RLFR 106 French Food Cultures (Not offered 2013-2014)
Two years ago, the French gastronomic meal won a place on UNESCO’s representative list of ”intangible cultural heritage.” Yet, as current political and cultural tensions in
France suggest, French food has never been more controversial. This course combines an intensive grammar review with a critical and experiential study of French food cultures.
Modules focus on gastronomy and the art of dégustation, the role of food in debates on religious, national, and regional identities, public health policy, and the war on malbouffe.
In addition to analyzing a broad range of texts, film, and other media, students will engage and strengthen their grammar and vocabulary when conducting field interviews,
visiting local producers, and experimenting in our class kitchen. Conducted in French.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 201 The Voice and the Book: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern France (Not offered 2013-2014)
We are a society of silent readers. Our eyes move back and forth over words on a screen or page, and the act feels private, interior. In earlier times, however, people interacted
differently with texts. Besides silent reading, texts were transmitted through recitation and improvisation for groups of listeners. This course offers an introduction to the key
periods, artistic movements, and genres of medieval and early modern France as they come to bear on the relationship between literature and orality. How did literary forms
circulate and develop before and after the invention of the printing press? When did people who write become “writers?” Who read, heard, and performed texts? Who didn’t?
Over the course of the semester, students will complete regular creative and analytical exercises, visit the Chapin Library and Special Collections, meet with guest speakers, and
practice declamation and performance. Readings to include anonymous authors as well as Marie de France, Villon, Labé, Ronsard, Molière, La Fontaine, Lafayette, Voltaire,
Rousseau. Conducted in French.
Format: lecture/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly online postings, three short papers, recitation, micro-performance, and final examination.
Prerequisites: RLFR 105, or by French placement exam, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to French majors and those with

RLFR 202 War and Resistance: Two Centuries of War Literature in France, 1804-2004 (Same as WGSS 201) (Not offered 2013-2014)
In 1883, Maupassant called on his fellow war veterans and writers to join him in speaking out against warfare and violence, crying “Let us dishonor war!” From the Gallic Wars
against Caesar (during the first century BC) to France’s controversial role in the “War on Terror” (at the opening of the twenty-first century), the French literary tradition is rich in
texts that bear witness to war and speak out against its monstrous inhumanity. While war literature in France can be traced back to ancient and medieval texts on Vercingétorix,
Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, and Joan of Arc, this course will focus specifically on literary representations of war during the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, from
the Napoleonic Wars, to the First and Second World Wars, to the Algerian and Cold Wars, and the “War on Terror.” Discussions will examine the impact of war on soldiers and
civilians, patriotism and pacifism, history and memory; the implications of war as invasion and conquest, occupation and resistance, victory and defeat; the relationship of war to
gender, sexuality, and ethnicity; and the role of war in colonialism and genocide. Readings to include novels, short stories, and poems by Balzac, Stendhal, Hugo, Rimbaud,
Daudet, Maupassant, Zola, Cocteau, Wiesel, Duras, Camus, and Fanon. Films to include works by Resnais, Renoir, Carion, Jeunet, Malle, Angelo, Pontecorvo, and Duras.
Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: RLFR 105 or 106; 201 or 203; or by placement test, or by permission of instructor.

RLFR 203(F) Introduction to Francophone Studies (Same as AFR 204) (D)
The Francophone world, stretching across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas, has often been described as a family joined by a shared
language and condition born of colonial history. Through fiction and film, this course will examine what it means to be Francophone, and how writers and filmmakers from the
Francophone world have approached the idea of family both literally and metaphorically in order to explore questions of identity, origins, colonialism, resistance, nationhood and
interconnectedness in a global community. This course invites students to enter into critical engagement with cultural constructions of difference, colonial and post-colonial
constructions of subjectivity, culturally contested imaginations and treatment of gender and race, and the very idea of the Francophone itself. Authors we will read include: Driss
Chraibi (Morocco), Dany Laferrière (Haiti), Maryse Condé (Guadeloupe), Aimé Césaire (Martinique), Linda Lê (Vietnam) and Fatou Diome (Senegal). Films studied include
Moolaadé (Ousmane Sembène), La vie sur terre (Abderrahman Sissoko) and Abouna (Mahamet-Saleh Haroun). Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, informal response papers, two short papers, and final paper.
Prerequisites: RLFR 105 or above, or results of College Placement Examination, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to French

RLFR 208 Love and Death in Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth-Century France (Not offered 2013-2014)
Reflecting on loneliness and a life without anyone to love and be loved by, Maupassant declared in 1884: “It is better to love, but terrible.” This introductory course in French
literature will focus on this “terrible” aspect of love. The themes of instincts and passions, desires and fears, death and sexuality, death and love have been exploited in art literature, painting, music - for centuries. Why do so many authors create an erotic bond between love and death? In this course, we will examine how passion sometimes leaves
no other alternative but the death of its “slaves,” how some characters find sexual gratification in killing the objects of their love, or eroticize and resurrect the dead in a fascinating, macabre, erotic encounter. Suicide, murder, and necrophilia will be studied in their close relationship with sexuality and love. Readings to include novels, short stories, and
poems by Corneille, Racine, Rousseau, Sade, Musset, Hugo, Zola, Baudelaire, and Maupassant, as well as paintings and films representing seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth-century France. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: RLFR 105 or 106; 201, 202, or 203; or by placement test; or permission of instructor.. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). If overenrolled, preference given to
French majors and certificate students, and those with compelling justification for admission.
RLFR 224(S) (formerly 310) Sexuality and Seduction in Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century France (Same as WGSS 224) (D)
In 1857, both Flaubert’s Madame Bovary and Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du mal were put on trial for sexual indecency and “crimes against public morality.” In 1868, Le Figaro
attacked Zola’s novel Thérèse Raquin as “putrid literature” for its depiction of adultery, murder, and scandalous sexuality in nineteenth-century Paris. A century later, Gide,
Colette, and Duras continued to shock French readers with their extraordinary novels on male and female homosexuality, inter-generational lovers, and bi-racial relationships. In
this course, we will examine a wide range of issues on eroticism and sexuality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century French literature, including marriage and adultery, seduction
and desire, love and betrayal, prostitution and fetishism, gay and lesbian identity, cross-dressing and gender representation, exoticism and colonial (s)exploitation. Readings to
include novels, shorts stories, and poems by Chateaubriand, Constant, Duras, Balzac, Flaubert, Baudelaire, Zola, Maupassant, Barbey d’Aurevilly, Gide, Proust, Colette, Duras,
and Guibert. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: RLFR 106 or 107; another 200–level course such as RLFR 201, 202, 203; or by placement test; or by permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:

RLFR 230(S) Introduction to French Stylistics: The Art of Pastiche (W)
Generally speaking, pasticheurs are derivative artists. Yet many of France’s most original authors were agile pasticheurs, among them La Bruyère, Proust, and the experimental
writers of the OuLiPo movement. What might the art of pastiche suggest about the relationship between imitation and creation, tradition and innovation, and past and present?
Discussion of such questions will be grounded in the study of short texts by Rimbaud (as Villon), Zalmanski (as Madame de Sévigné), Janin (as Diderot), Flaubert (as Chateaubriand), and Queneau (as Proust). Analysis and explication of pastiches will strengthen students’ technical grasp of French. In the second half of the semester, students will apply
their rhetorical, syntactical, and stylistic knowledge through weekly pastiche exercises, submitted as a final portfolio at semester’s end. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements:active class participation, individual meetings, biweekly postings, 3 compositions (2 drafts each) and final portfolio.
Prerequisites: RLFR 105-106 or examination placement. Enrollment limit:19 (expected:19). Preference will be given to majors and those completing a French Certificate .

RLFR 240 Molière in Performance (Not offered 2013-2014)
Like Shakespeare, the work of France’s greatest playwright is less a timeless monument than a living body, perpetually in motion, yet constantly changing. This course offers a
dual approach to the theater of Molière. The first half of the semester will focus on readings and analysis of printed plays: Le Dépit amoureux, L’Ecole des femmes, Tartuffe, Le
Misanthrope, L’Avare, Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, Les Fourberies de Scapin, and Le Malade imaginaire, among others. We will consider the broader socio-political, intellectual,
and aesthetic forces at work in the Age of Louis XIV, as well as the formal and thematic features of each play. Turning from the seventeenth century to the twentieth, the second
half of the semester will examine modern interpretations of Molière, especially those of major theater directors including Jouvet, Planchon, Vitez, and Mnouchkine. Discussions
will be informed by viewings as well as interviews, reviews, and critical essays. Throughout the semester, we will explore the dynamic relationships between tradition and
innovation, elite and popular culture, actors and audience, past and present. The semester culminates in student-led micro-performances inspired by our readings, viewings, and
discussions. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly online postings, a short midterm paper, final performance project and accompanying report
Prerequisites: RLFR 201, 202, or 203, or by permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to French, Comparative Literature, Theater, and

RLFR 308 The Libertine in Eighteenth and Nineteenth-Century French Novels (Not offered 2013-2014)
This seminar proposes to examine the bachelor in French literature, from the libertines of the eighteenth century to the romantic and naturalist heroes of the nineteenth century. By
studying their modus vivendi and modus operandi, we will try to trace the evolution of the figure of the “libertine” through novels and short stories by Crébillon-fils, Duclos,
Laclos, Sade, Stendhal, Flaubert, Zola, and Maupassant. Discussions will lead us to look for answers to the following questions: what is the bachelor’s approach to life, love, sex,
and women? Is the bachelor always in control of his instincts and emotions? What perversions are associated with the image of the libertine? Is there a link between libertinage
and folly? Is there such a thing as a female libertine? In what way does she differ from her male counterpart? How is the tension between love for oneself and love for the Other
represented or reconciled? Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: open to students who have take a literature course in French at Williams, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). If overenrolled, preference
given to French majors and certificate students, and those with compelling justification for admission.

RLFR 309 Contemporary Short Stories from North Africa: Fast Cars, Movies, Money, Love and War (Same as AFR 307) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Today the countries of North Africa are experiencing rapid social change. Rap music can be heard spilling out of windows while television sets broadcast a call to prayer. In the
market place, those selling their goods compete to be heard over the ringing of cell-phones. Old and new exist side by side, albeit sometimes very uncomfortably. During the past
decade, literature has emerged in both French and Arabic examining the effects of globalization: unequal modernization, unemployment, cultural change and cultural resistance.
In this course, we will read short stories that address these issues as well as analyze films, sociological texts and Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian newspapers on the web in order
to explore contemporary transformations of life in North Africa. Readings by Maissa Bey, Abdelfattah Kilito, Zeina Tabi, Mohamed Zafzaf, Ahmed Bouzfour, Soumaya Zahy
and Abdelhak Serhane among others. Conducted in French.
Requirements: active class participation, reading journal, two short papers, an oral presentation and a final paper.

RLFR 312 Francographic Islands (Same as AFR 312 and COMP 312) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Utopia, paradise, shipwreck, abandonment, exile, death. Man’s fascination and obsession with the island as a place of discovery, beauty and imprisonment stretches across the
centuries. In this class, we will read French literary and imagined islands alongside islands constructed by Francophone Caribbean, Indian Ocean and non-Western writers in
French. What does the island symbolize in individual, community, national, and imperial imaginations? And how does the island become an agent in discussions of gender, race,
modernity and history? Readings will include works by Paul Gauguin, Pierre Loti, Aimé Césaire, Michel Tournier, Ananda Devi, Maryse Condé, Patrick Chamoiseau and
Edouard Glissant. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly response papers, midterm essay and final essay.

RLFR 314 Between the Two World Wars (Not offered 2013-2014)
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will study novels by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac,
Malraux, and Sartre. Although there is great diversity among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World War and the breakdown of traditional French
culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious adolescent, they experimented with revolt against the stifling social order of Church and family. The real challenge of the
period, however, concerned not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature acceptance of responsibility for the future
and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in French. Requirements: several short papers and oral class presentations.
Prerequisites: any RLFR literature course or permission of the instructor.

RLFR 316 Paris on Fire: Incendiary Voices from the City of Light (1830-2005) (Same as WGSS 315) (Not offered 2013-2014)
During the 1830s, Balzac described Paris as a “surprising assemblage of movements, machines, and ideas, a city of one hundred thousand novels, the head of the world,” but also
characterized the French capital as a “land of contrasts,” a “monstrous wonder,” a “moral sewer.” Similarly, writers from Hugo to Zola have simultaneously celebrated Parisian
elegance and condemned the appalling misery of Paris’s urban poor. Since 1889, Paris has been fêted as the “City of Light” for its Enlightenment legacy, its Eiffel Tower
modernity, and its luminous urban energy, captured in countless paintings, photographs, and film. However, Paris is also the historical site of revolution, resistance, and riots.
From revolutionary revolt (1830, 1848, 1871), to wartime resistance (1870, 1914-18, 1940-44), to reformist and race riots (1968 and 2005), Paris has repetitively sparked with
incendiary passion and political protest. As fires raged during the recent riots in 2005, many heard the echo of Hitler’s ominous 1944 question, “Is Paris burning?” and asked: why
was Paris burning again at the dawn of the twenty-first century? To answer this question, we will examine the social, political, and literary landscape of Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from urbanization and modernization, to occupation and liberation, to immigration and globalization. Readings to include poetry, short stories, and
novels by Hugo, Balzac, Baudelaire, Maupassant, Verne, Zola, Apollinaire, Colette, Duras, Perec, Rochefort, and Charef. Films to include works by Clair, Truffaut, Godard,
Minnelli, Clément, Lelouch, Luhrmann, Kassovitz, Besson, and Jeunet. Conducted in French.

RLFR 318(F) Twentieth-Century Novel: From Adversity to Modernity (Same as COMP 318)
In his futurist novel Paris in the Twentieth Century (1863), Jules Verne envisions an era of technological superiority, complete with hydrogen cars and high-speed trains, televisions and skyscrapers, computers and the internet. But in Verne’s vision of modernity, technological sophistication gives way to intellectual stagnation and social indifference, in
a world where poetry and literature have been abandoned in favor bureaucratic efficiency, mechanized surveillance, and the merciless pursuit of profit. To contest or confirm this
dystopic vision, we will examine a broad range of twentieth-century novels and their focus on adversity, dignity, and modernity. In a century dominated by the devastation of two
World Wars, the atrocities of colonial empire, and massive social and political transformation, the novel both documented and interrogated France’s engagement with race and
ethnicity, gender and sexuality, colonialism and immigration. Within this historical context, we will discuss the role of the novel in confronting war and disease, challenging
poverty and greed, and exposing urban isolation and cultural alienation in twentieth-century France. Readings to include novels by Colette, Genet, Camus, Duras, Ernaux,
Guibert, and Begag. Lectures to include discussions of Gide and Proust, Sartre and Beauvoir, Cixous and Foucault, Jelloun and Djébar. Films to include works by Fassbinder,
Annaud, Lioret, Ducastel, Martineau, Téchiné, and Charef.
Format: seminar. Conducted in French. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: a 200–level course such as RLFR 201, 202, 203; or by placement test; or by permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference to French
majors and certificate students; Comparative Literature majors; and those with compelling justification for admission. Seniors returning from study abroad (in France or another Francophone country) are particularly welcome.

RLFR 320T Slums and Housing Projects: Writing Urban Margins in French and Francophone Literature (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this course we will explore the politics and poetics of fiction that engages marginalized urban spaces in France and the francophone world. From the depiction of informal
settlements in Martinique in Patrick Chamoiseau’s epic novel Texaco to the shantytowns of Casablanca in Mahi Binebine’s Les étoiles de Sidi Moumen to the Parisian housing
projects in Gisèle Pineau’s Un papillon dans la cité and Didier Mandin’s Banlieue Voltaire, we will explore how literature represents neighborhoods that exist in the face of
dominant discourses of urban redevelopment that work to destroy them. What voices and histories emerge from these spaces under aggression? And how does literature claim to
speak from and for these marginalized communities? Readings will include both literary works and theoretical readings from urban studies and geography. Conducted in French.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: six 5-page tutorial papers.
Prerequisites: any RLFR literature course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to French and Comparative Literature majors.

This course will explore relationships between culture and imperialism in France by exploring how the colonial “Other” has been conceived, displayed and collected in French
museums, world’s fairs and galleries from the 19th century to the present. Through readings in museum history and theory, we will explore the imperial histories of the Louvre
and the Musée de l’Homme, the role of Parisian World’s Fairs in ordering the colonial world, French colonial photography and the creation a body of consumable subjects, and
the discourse of collection and preservation in French colonial architecture. Drawing on museum theory, we will also critically examine contemporary Parisian museums such as
the Musée du Quai Branly, the Institut du Monde Arabe and the Cité nationale de l’histoire de l’immigration. In addition to readings and discussion, the class will engage in a
semester-long group project to design a new museum of French history and identity. The group will present all aspects of their museum including location, design, exhibit

RLFR 410(S) Senior Seminar: Landscapes of Movement and Migration in French
How do migration and movement construct and disrupt landscapes of identity—home, city and nation—in the French-speaking world? How do migration and movement
contribute to conditions of alienation, nostalgia and violence? This seminar explores such fundamental questions and asks us to think about how in an increasingly mobile and
de-territorialized world, place is imagined, experienced and remembered. Over the course of the semester, we will examine theoretical texts on memory, space, identity and
movement, and analyze literary and film narratives of migration that focus on: the immigration experience in France, the construction of an Atlantic identity between Africa, the
Caribbean, Europe and the Americas, internal migration between the country and the city, clandestine migration between Africa and Europe, population displacement due to war,
and the possibility of creating portable places of memory. Works by Nora, Benjamin, Deleuze, Barthes, Charef, Chamoiseau, Glissant, Diome, Condé, Mernissi, Poulain, Pineau,

RLFR 412 Senior Seminar: Nineteenth-Century Novel: From Desperate Housewives to Extreme Makeovers (Same as WGSS 408) (Not offered
2013-2014)
In 1834, Balzac wrote that “Paris is a veritable ocean. Sound it: you will never know its depth.” The same can be said of the French nineteenth-century novel and its boundless
ability to echo the historical past and reverberate in the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and extreme makeovers fill the pages
of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and Hugo, and the Realism of Balzac and Flaubert, to the Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel
became an extraordinary forum for examining illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, criminal passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious
undergraduate Rastignac, the domestically-abused Gervaise, and the man-eating courtesan Nana became synonymous with France’s turbulent social and political landscape
from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make clear, these characters continue to haunt our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary
actors as Gérard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel continues to sound out the scandalous and
sensational depths of our own century. Readings to include novels by Balzac, Stendhal, Hugo, Flaubert, Maupassant, and Zola. Films to include adaptations by Clément, Berri,
August, Arteta, Lelouch, and Chabrol. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: a 200-level or 300-level RLFR literature course at Williams, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). If overenrolled, preference will be

RLFR 415 Senior Seminar: Banned In France: Literature and Censorship in the Eighteenth Century France (Not offered 2013-2014)
Censorship is probably as old as culture itself, but recent global debates over network neutrality, media regulation, and copyright reveal a growing sense of urgency over what
role, if any, censorship should play in the digital age. This seminar will explore the role of censorship in eighteenth-century France, another complex period transformed in part by
unprecedented access to knowledge. Students will critically assess a range of works that were, before or after publication, repressed or altered by various religious and civil
authorities, editors, publishers, and, in some cases, audiences. Discussions will focus on the formal and thematic content of each work, as well as its broader place in Enlightenment and French Revolutionary literature and culture. Analysis of such historically-specific concepts as tolerance, obscenity, and public censorship will be supported by critical
work and commentary from the eighteenth century and the present day. As a central feature of the course, students will conduct a semester-long research project that will draw on
readings from Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, Sade, Beaumarchais, Chénier, Gouges, Charrière, Staël, and others. Key issues include copyright and the literary market, self-censorship, public opinion and public censure, gender and canon formation, blasphemy, pornography, and the politics of incitement. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly online postings, semester-long research project involving an abstract and annotated bibliography at mid-term,
and final research paper.
Prerequisites: any 200-level RLFR course. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:15). Preference given to senior French majors or students completing the Certificate in French, but

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 105, 106, any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and
403. At least one 200-level course must be completed at Williams. In addition, one course must be focused primarily on literature of the period prior to 1800 C.E. Other courses,
taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the requirements of the major, with approval of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201
and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so before rather than after studying abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreciation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of
the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level
or higher, or with a course in Linguistics or Latina/o Studies.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is
expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and literature. RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and culture, while
other 200-level classes serve as gateway courses for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and sophomores. Courses in the 300s
require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced command of the language. The 400-level course offered annually is the senior seminar, serving as
“capstone course” to the Spanish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply
for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis
proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some
cases, and upon consultation with the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for example, when the thesis is
interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be
made to the focus and scope of the project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study
period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semester, students will
normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably
rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a departmental colloquium in Spanish. The thesis will be promptly
discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent writing
more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring
term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy,
English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030) in the
spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by
November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department’s recommendation for graduation with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the
finished project.

THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In
addition, the student must take a proficiency test and achieve a score of “Advanced.” The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of April to all
students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102, Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level,
with at least one of these courses at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition to the three courses in Spanish
beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural
history (art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective
requirement.
Electives may be considered from a variety of departments and programs. However, students should consult with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the
101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part
of their program at Williams. Through its special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a comprehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to four courses can be granted at the discretion of the Department for study
overseas. Students interested in study abroad should consult with a member of the department at their earliest convenience.

RLSP 201(F) The Cultures of Spain
Linguistically, culturally, and historically Spain is a composite of the groups that have inhabited the peninsula in the past, which include Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks,
Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs, and Jews. The contributions of these different groups, combined with other factors such as geography and climate, will be our starting
point in understanding Spain’s past. Today, Spain’s cultural diversity also reflects the many distinct autonomous regions of which the country is composed, such as Cataluña and
the Basque country, and the recent influx of immigrants from all over the world. In this course we will consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance and
cultural brilliance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as times of violence, censorship and repression such as the Inquisition, the Civil War
and the post-war under Franco. Materials will include representative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts will also be provided for historical
and socio-political background and reference. Conducted in Spanish.

RLSP 202T 1898: Spain’s Fin de Siglo and the Crisis of Ideas (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
In this tutorial we will read the works of some of modern Spain’s influential writers from the late part of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of the twentieth. Our aim
is to understand how fiction and philosophy represented this significant time in Spain’s history. The loss of the war with the U.S. in 1898, the turbulent shifts of power within the
country, Spanish regional identities, and the cultural and intellectual movements that shaped Spain on the eve of the Civil War are among the key issues we will address. Our
primary sources—largely fiction and poetry by artists such as Miguel de Unamuno, Azorín, Ramiro de Maeztú, Antonio Machado, Pío Baroja—will be complemented with a
rigorous study of the cultural landscape of Spain at that time. Our principal engagement with philosophy will be through José Ortega y Gasset, in particular his output from the
1920s.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will be teamed in groups of two, and alternate in writing essays and critiquing these each week. Essays will be 5-8 pages long. Evaluation is based on the essay and the critique of the essay, as well as punctuality with submission of weekly assignments.

RLSP 204 Icons and Imaginaries: Culture and Politics in Latin America (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This course provides an overview of Latin American culture and politics by focusing on some of the most recognizable names and faces from the continent’s turbulent history:
Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés and Malintzín, Simón Bolívar, José Martí, Pancho Villa, Eva Perón, Frida Kahlo, Che Guevara, Rigoberta Menchú and Hugo Chávez. In
addition to exploring the controversies surrounding each figure and her or his influence within a specific historical context, we’ll also unpack some of the overarching issues of
Latin American culture and politics: How are nations and nationalism constructed through processes of representation, and what roles do specific iconic figures play in that
process? How can popular culture challenge elite representations of the nation and its heroes/heroines, and how durable are the images it produces as expressions of collective
will? What opportunities are available to women and sexual minorities in a political culture that has been historically dominated by macho military types? This course fulfills the
EDI requirement by enabling students to appreciate the figures that have influenced generations of Latin American women and men and their sense of what is politically possible,
while challenging the class to identify the operations of power at work in the construction of the figures themselves.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assignments will include political and cultural essays, literature and films. Three 5-page papers. Conducted in Spanish.

The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that to this day reflect widely antagonistic interpretations of the conflict itself, its roots,
and its impact. From the Spanish perspective, the war is the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The ideals, passions, and consequences of the Spanish
Civil War still divide Spaniards and have been recreated and relived by writers, artists, and filmmakers, and debated by historians. The course will begin with a historical
introduction to the origins, development, and outcome of the war. Was the Spanish war a national struggle or an international struggle played out on Spanish soil? Along with
studying internal Spanish political divisions, we will also consider the impact of the foreign policy positions of other countries-including Germany, Italy, the United States, and
Russia—vis-a-vis Spain, as well as the role of the thousands of foreign volunteers who formed the International Brigades and came from all over the world to fight against
Franco. With this historical basis, we will see how the themes and issues of the war are reflected in Spanish poetry, short fiction, novels, and films from the time of the war up
through the present day. Readings will include works by Ayala, Cernuda, Neruda, Goytisolo, Sender, Fernan-Gomez, and Matute. Films will include documentaries as well as
classic and contemporary features. Conducted in Spanish.
Evaluations will be based on lively class participation, an oral report, short written assignments, and two papers.
Prerequisites: RLSP 201, permission of instructor, or results of the Williams College Placement Exam. Enrollment limit: 20.

RLSP 211(S) Survey of Medieval and Golden Age Spanish Literature
This course will introduce the student to some of the major works of Spanish literature from its beginnings through the Golden Age. We will study the historical context in which
the works were written as well as the literary history of the periods in question. Students will learn methods of textual analysis through readings of relevant literary criticism.
Readings will include selected canonical prose, poetry, and drama of the periods; special emphasis will be given to the myth of the coexistence of three religions in Iberia and the
very idea of periodization in literature. Conducted in Spanish.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, short paper assignments, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: RLSP 105 or 106 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 12:00-12:50 MWF

RLSP 217T Love in the Spanish Golden Age (Not offered 2013-2014)(W)
The principal focus of this course is the Spanish “comedia” of the seventeenth century (with supplemental readings from prose and poetry) to provide us with a dynamic and
critical understanding of the theme of love as constructed by the greatest dramatists and authors of the period. Works by Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Calderón, Cervantes, San
Juan de la Cruz, and others will show us how the theme was treated from diverse perspectives, and how it related to key concepts such as honor, religion, and artistic creativity.
Conducted in Spanish or English depending on student ability.
Students will meet with the instructor each week in groups of two. One student will read a 5-page paper, left in advance for the tutorial partner, and the other will critique the
paper. Evaluation is based on the quality of the weekly essays and critiques, as well as evidence of preparation, punctuality of submission, and quality of discussion. By the end of
the semester each student will have produced around 25 pages of writing.
Prerequisites: RLSP 105 and above or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to students with a background in literature.

RLSP 220 Modern Spanish Women: Literature and Life (Same as WGSS 222) (Not offered 2013-2014)
From the early twentieth century to the present day, the radical changes in the lives of Spanish women have clearly reflected the tug of war between progress and tradition in
recent Spanish history. The dramatic upheavals in Spanish politics have marked and transformed the lives of women to such a great extent that one can often gauge the political
and social climate of any given historical moment by considering how the role of women was defined by the law, the Catholic church, education, and other social and political
institutions. Using literary and historical texts as well as films and graphic materials, this course will look at the transformations in the public and private lives of Spanish women
during the following periods: the turn of the century, the Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War, the Franco years, and the transition to democracy.
Format: seminar.
Prerequisites: RLSP 201, permission of the instructor, or acceptable results of the Williams College Placement Exam. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to
Spanish and Comparative Literature majors.

RLSP 222(F) Mexican Underworlds: Visual Configurations of Life beneath the Ground
The notion of the underworld evokes several images: mythical hell, the space of the repressed, and the breeding ground of conspiracy, to name just a few. In this course we will
explore how the image of the underground appears repeatedly in Mexican cultural objects throughout history. We will use the theoretical approach of visual studies and
psychoanalysis to explore the multiple meanings that the underground can carry when we think about it as a relation between concealment and revelation. Our readings will
include Aztec and Mayan myths; classic novels by Azuela, Revueltas, and Rulfo; essays by Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes; contemporary novels by Roberto Bolaño and
Guadalupe Nettel; and films. Attendance at the three film screenings outside the scheduled class time is required. Canonical Mexican texts will be re–read from a visual studies
perspective, incorporating visual studies as a critical discourse separate from but compatible with literary studies.
Format: combination lecture and seminar. There will be two short essays (2–3 pages) due on weeks 5 and 10, an annotated bibliography, a final paper (5 pages), and a class
presentation based on the final paper.Every main reading/topic will be introduced by a 15–20 minute lecture, followed by discussion questions. The course will have a Glow site
in which students will post their initial responses to the readings in advance as preparation for class discussion.
Prerequisites: RLSP 105 or higher. Enrollment limit: 22.

ROMERO

RLSP 230 Fantastic Fictions ) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Jorge Luis Borges may be the least Latin American of all Latin American authors, or perhaps the most. In the wake of his own statement that “Every writer creates his own
precursors” he has already provided the theoretical premise for so much subsequent work that this can only be a selective course. While our primary focus will be the fantastic in
Borges’ short stories, with initial forays into the work of Silvina Ocampo, Adolfo Bioy Casares, María Luisa Bombal, and Juan José Arreola, we will also study his influence on
Julio Cortázar, Luisa Valenzuela, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Roberto Bolaño. The course will include at least some consideration of Borges’ impact on the visual arts, and his
abiding legacy beyond Latin America. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active discussion of ideas, one oral presentation, two short papers, and one final paper.
Prerequisites: RLSP 105, placement test results, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

RLSP 238(S) The Textual City (W)
This course will chart the development of identity within the postcolonial Latin American city, focusing on (though by no means limited to) Buenos Aires as a touchstone case.
The latter will be read both literally and as a guiding metaphor, as a reality ordered by ideas. We will use interdisciplinary theoretical models as discursive markers, selected from
history, architecture, politics, philosophy, literature, and photography, in order to problematize urban design, the site of real dystopia, as the organizer of symbolic space, and vice
versa. Spatio-cultural discussion will focus on the dominant narratives of public topography, most notably that of capitalism, and private, individualized responses to them, not
least in the work of Carriego, Girondo, Borges, Arlt, Cortázar, Walsh, Sebreli, Piglia and Schweblin. Conducted in Spanish, with some secondary / tertiary reading in English.
Format: lecture/seminar. Requirements: two 5-page papers over the first half, and a 12- to 15-page research project (with preliminary presentation) over the second half, all of
which will be defended through active participation.

RLSP 242(F) (formerly 319) Latin American Travel Writing (W)
Beyond Columbus’ errant journey into the abyss and the ensuing quest for El Dorado, or Darwin’s Voyage of the Beagle, Latin America’s interior has often enticed its own
learned population. Their travels, in space, time and thought, do not merely present a physical confrontation with alterity, with the continent’s supposed heart of darkness, but an
intellectual clearing, an origin, from which a more equitable politics may begin. To name but one example, Alejo Carpentier’s Los pasos perdidos, the tale of a New York
composer’s journey to the beginning of society and music, is often seen as the touchstone of Latin American identity. Through accounts of real and fictitious travels, from
Carpentier to the crassest of guidebooks, we will study such quests for self. These domestic departures will frame debates on ethics, representation, and epistemology. For
comparison’s sake, there will be occasional primary and secondary texts on English. Readings will include work by Sarmiento, Gorriti, Mansilla, Vasconcelos, Borges, Bioy
Casares, Che Guevara, Allende, Sepúlveda, and Crosthwaite. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two 5-page papers over the first half, and a 12- to 15-page research project over the second half, all of which will be defended through
active participation.

RLSP 301 Cervantes’ Don Quijote (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)(D)
This course is an in-depth study of Miguel de Cervantes’ masterpiece Don Quijote (1605, 1615). The linguistic, literary, and cultural richness of Cervantes’ novel will allow us to
explore the historical complexity of the society in which it was produced, circulated, and read. In order to complement and contextualize our close reading of Cervantes’ text, we
will rely on historical documentation, works of art, iconography, other literary works from the period, and contemporary critical studies. Issues to be dealt with include humor,
carnival, and popular cultures, the representation of Mediterranean cultural encounters, the material world and the social fabric of early modern Iberia, and the narrative and
rhetorical makeup of the novel. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, oral presentations, short writing assignments, and a final essay.

RLSP 306T(S) Latino Writing: Literature by U.S. Hispanics (Same as COMP 302T) (W)
Writing by U.S. Hispanics constitutes a new voice in American letters. In this tutorial, we will read and discuss work by U.S. Latinos and examine the social backgrounds to their
texts. The experiences of immigration and assimilation, and the specific complexities of being both Hispanic and North American will be addressed. Authors to be studied: Jose
Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Richard Rodriguez, Sandra Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya, Piri Thomas, Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina Garcia, Junot Diaz, and historical texts by Carey
McWilliams and Rodolfo Acuña. Given the absence of a critical consensus around these recent titles, our task is to gain some sense of their common traits as a tradition, and place
them within the larger body of literature of the Americas and the world. The tutorial will examine one work or set of works per week. A student will bring, written out in full, an
oral presentation focusing on the artistic features and sociocultural content of the assigned reading. Questioning of the presenter, on the part of the second tutee and the tutor, will
follow. The course is designed to accommodate both Spanish and English speaking students; for Spanish majors it is to be conducted in Spanish. A student able to read and speak
Spanish will be paired with another student of similar proficiency. Students who neither read nor speak Spanish will be paired together.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: five short oral presentations/papers (about 20-25 minutes) and a final longer one.
Prerequisites: some previous course work in any literature beyond the 100 level is helpful. Students selecting the Spanish option for credit toward the Spanish major must have
taken at least one 200-level RLSP course or seek permission of the tutor. Enrollment limit: 10.

RLSP 308 The Subject of Empire: Race, Gender and Power in the Colonial Era (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This class studies Latin American literature of the colonial era (1492-1898) from the perspective of the constitution of the subject: the autobiographical ‘yo’ that is both the
subject of discourse and the object of sovereign power. Our readings will include the most outstanding texts of the group collectively known as the Chronicles of the Conquest the letters of Christopher Columbus and Hernán Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s True History of the Conquest of New Spain, among others - whose authors endeavor to
establish their historical authority and legitimate their actions before the Spanish king. We will also read later works in which racially and sexually marginalized subjects struggle
to contest the identities and the conditions imposed on them by a distant sovereign through far-reaching institutional networks: the mestizo historian known as El Inca Garcilaso
de la Vega, the cross-dressed soldier Catalina de Erauso, the poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, and the slave Juan Francisco Manzano. This course fulfills the objectives of the
Exploring Diversity Initiative by challenging students to examine the historical negotiation of individual and collective identities within the context of violent, exploitative and
exclusionary structures of power.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short (7-page) paper, one longer (15-20 page) paper, proposal, bibliography, discussion-leading.

RLSP 318 Three Spanish Medieval Masterpieces and the Myth of Co-existence (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
A common assumption about Spain is that in its medieval period members of the three religions co-existed in harmony, worked together, and influenced one another. This is an
attractive myth for sure, but also a very simplistic one. It does not begin to take into account the complexity of Iberia, whose regional identities, crises of sovereignty and complicated allegiances were hardly ever constant in the medieval period. The very notions of “influence” and “co-existence,” which have long governed general assumptions about
medieval Spain, become problematic if considered in the context of the actual time and place in which they are supposed to have occurred. Centered on the thorough reading of
three masterpieces of the medieval period—El Cid, El libro de buen amor and La Celestina—we will explore, specifically, Castilian culture across three different periods, with
an attempt to make connections to key concepts that will give us a nuanced and fair understanding of medieval Spain’s extraordinarily rich and multifaceted identities.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation; three short papers; one research paper; one collaborative presentation.
Prerequisites: any RLSP 200-level class or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12). Preference given to seniors and juniors in RLSP, Comparative Literature

RLSP 402(S) Senior Seminar: Madrid: 1939-2004
In this course we will examine life in Madrid during two key periods: the Franco Dictatorship (1939-1975), and the first three decades of democracy (1975-2004). We will consider how
representations of urban landscapes (churches, convents, prisons, museums, slums, bars and schools) has shaped and reflected the lives of madrileñas and madrileños past and present.
We will study works by 20th century and contemporary Spanish authors, filmmakers, photographers, and journalists, as well as period advertisements and examples of popular culture.
How was Madrid’s image as international capital of art, sun, soccer and bullfighting forged? What remnants of the past lurk behind this appealing façade? How do the Atocha train Station
bombings of 2004 relate to unresolved political tensions from 1939?

RLSP 402 Senior Seminar: Writing Latin America’s Environmental Crisis (Not offered 2013-2014)
Disappearing rain forests, melting glacier ice, sprawling garbage dumps, toxic fields and water: the state of environmental crisis is as real in Latin America as it is elsewhere on
the planet, and its impact on the region’s poor, marginalized and indigenous communities is extremely severe. This seminar explores the socio-cultural context and ramifications
of the current crisis by examining Latin America’s environmental literature of the 20th and 21st centuries. Readings will range from literary classics by writers like José Eustacio
Rivera, Octavio Paz and Giaconda Belli to the blogs of contemporary environmental activists. Keeping in mind the role of neocolonialism and globalization in accelerating
environmental degradation, we’ll explore the influence of Latin America’s heterogeneous cultural traditions on the relationship between human groups and the natural world, the
significance of race, gender, class and ethnicity for an individual or collective sense of place, the phenomenon of environmental trauma, and the representational challenges and
strategies available to environmentally-engaged writers and artists.
Conducted entirely in Spanish. As the capstone experience for the Spanish major, class meetings will follow a seminar format. In addition to written assignments (one 5-7 page
paper and one 15-20 page paper) students will also be evaluated on the basis of their regular participation and performance as discussion leaders.

Military dictatorship is among the most crucial factors in Latin-American society and history, and some of the continent’s leading novelists have taken it upon themselves to
depict the experience in their work. In this course we will examine both the fact of dictatorship itself and the diverse representation thereof in Spanish-American fiction. Novels

Chair, Professor JANNEKE VAN DE STADT
Professors: CASSIDAY, GOLDSTEIN**. Associate Professor: VAN DE STADT. Visiting Assistant Professor: LADYGINA. Teaching Associate: MATUNOVA
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W88-102
covers the basics of Russian grammar. Russian 151 through 252 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading and conversation.

STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics.
Students generally apply to one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 152 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prerequisite for study abroad.

LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become
acquainted with the major achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.

THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student’s educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence
of language and culture courses is designed to supplement a student’s major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowledge in a related field.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses for all the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two
of the required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three courses in Russian) after enrolling at Williams. The
student must achieve proficiency at the level of a B in RUSS 251 or the equivalent.

Required Courses

102
151
152
one additional course conducted in Russian

Electives
—at least one course on Russian cultural history
—at least one course on Russian intellectual, political, or social history, or post-Soviet economics

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major
by combining courses in Russian language and literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art. The major requires a minimum of ten courses of
which at least six must be conducted in Russian, at least two must be at the 300-level, and one at the 400-level. In addition, students may take up to four related courses offered by
other departments and taught in English.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Siècle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Sociology 332 Communism and its Aftermath
Students selecting the major must typically complete Russian 152 or the equivalent by the end of the junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take the 400-level
seminar offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken another version of it. Russian majors may receive major credit for summer language study (in consultation
with the department) and for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candidacy for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the
latest, however, they will have established in consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of study to be followed, and the
standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.
RUSS 101(F)-W88-102(S) Elementary Russian
An introduction to contemporary standard Russian, this course provides opportunities to acquire basic proficiency in all four language skills: listening comprehension, speaking,
reading, and writing, through intensive use of authentic written materials and a strong emphasis on the spoken word in all class activities. Greater emphasis is placed on writing in
the second semester. For students who have studied Russian in secondary school, consultation with the instructor is required before registering for any Russian language course in
the sequence 101 through 252.
Format: the class meets five hours a week. Requirements: active class participation, completion of all assignments, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

RUSS 151(F), 152(S) Continuing Russian
This course develops all four skills-conversation, listening comprehension, reading, and composition-for students who have completed at least one year of college-level Russian.
Coursework includes a systematic review of Russian grammar, as well as an examination of a variety of materials from Russian and Soviet culture, current events, and daily life.
Intermediate students will concentrate on expanding their vocabulary, while more advanced students will focus on reading and writing about unabridged texts in Russian. Students who complete the yearlong sequence of RUSS 151 and RUSS 152 should be well prepared to undertake study abroad in Russia and are encouraged to do so. Each year this
course is custom designed to meet the needs of those students who enroll, so that both intermediate-level and advanced students can benefit from taking RUSS 151 and/or RUSS
152 more than once, which may be done with the permission of the instructor.
Format: the class meets four hours a week, three with the professor and the fourth with the Russian Teaching Associate (time to be arranged). Requirements: active class participation, completion of all assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.
Prerequisites for 151: completion of at least one year of college-level Russian (RUSS 101-102) or permission of the instructor. Prerequisites for 152: RUSS 151 or permission of

RUSS 203(F) 19th-Century Russian Literature in Translation (Same as COMP 203)
Whereas 18th–century Russian literature was largely derivative and imitative, 19th–century Russian literature—literature of The Golden Age—developed into a distinct national
literature. It acquired its own style, developed along its own trajectory, and engaged with local social and political topics. This course will offer a survey of major works of
Russian 19th–century fiction from Pushkin, the “father” of modern Russian literature, through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov. Primary materials will be supplemented by
readings in cultural and intellectual history (Chaadaev, Belinsky, Herzen, Pisarev, and Dobrolyubov) to help us better understand the milieu in which 19th–century Russian
literature developed. The course will consist of short introductory lectures and discussions devoted to analyzing stylistic, cultural, and ideological idiosyncrasies of our primary
texts. In addition to examining each author’s distinctive style and contribution to Russian and world literature, we will explore a number of critical themes that have come to
define the 19th–century Russian intellectual discourse: the rise of the Russian Empire and its encounter with East and West; the haunting duality of Russian urban and rural life;
and the role of the Russian nobility and intelligentsia in Russia’s cultural and socio–political transformation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: include a short term paper, a midterm, and a final.

RUSS 204 Twentieth-Century Russian Literature: From Revolution to Perestroika (Same as COMP 204) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Whether despite or precisely because of the enormous historical and political turbulence in twentieth-century Russia, the intensity of its cultural life was equally unprecedented.
Over the period of nearly seventy years, Russian literature went through a number of major stages that defined its poetics and ideology: the Silver Age and its decline; the
Revolution, the Civil War and the rise of Socialist Realism as the official literary method; the exodus of Russian writers abroad in the 1920s; the birth of a new proletarian type,

274

worshiped by Soviet authors and mocked by the anti-Soviet ones; the Second World War; the Thaw and de-Stalinization, when the Gulag seemed to have floated to the surface;
another wave of tightening of the regime during the “stagnation period,” the dissident movement and the Cold War; another mass emigration to Europe, Israel and the U.S.; and
finally—the dissolution of the Soviet empire and the rise of Russian postmodernism. As we discuss these and other topics of twentieth-century Russian culture, we will find
ourselves immersed into the mechanisms of literary humor and comicality (e.g., in Mikhail Zoshchenko’s short stories and Ilf and Petrov’s picaresque novel The Twelve Chairs),
the elements of the supernatural (in Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita), the ways of how Russian writers portray urban space (e.g., Moscow, in Venedikt Erofeev’s
Moscow to the End of the Line), and how Soviet history is reinvented when censorship is replaced with market economy (in Viktor Pelevin’s Generation P). Literary texts will be
supplemented with occasional film screenings. All readings and discussions are in English.
Format: Requirements: class attendance and participation, weekly reading responses (pre-circulated among class members), one class presentation (15-20 minutes), and a term
paper.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 20). Preference given to Russian majors.

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History
This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine
culinary practice as well as the social context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between culture and cuisine, we will discuss such
issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette of the table, the role of drinking and temperance movements, and the importance of feasts and fasts in the Russian
Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide insight into class and gender differences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that
characterize Russian cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predominantly domestic point of view that originates from the wooden spoon as much as from the
scepter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, weekly response papers, one 6-page paper, midterm and final exams , and participation in a communal feast.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference give to students who can demonstrate an interest in Russian culture.

RUSS 208 Twentieth-Century Russian Art and the Birth of Abstraction (Same as ArtH 266) (Not offered 2013-2014)
Such revolutionary artistic movements as Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism, and Constructivism profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century art throughout the
Western world—just as the 1917 Russian Revolution upset the world’s political balance. This course will investigate Russian art within a cultural framework and explore the
relationship between artistic production and politics. We will begin with a brief overview of important developments in Russian art that prefigured the twentieth-century artistic
revolution: the introduction of icons from Byzantium, the founding of St. Petersburg and the rise of Western-style portraiture, and the fin-de-siècle movements that united painting with music and ballet. However, the focus of the course will be 1910-1930, when radical innovation was the order of the day and revolutionary ideas sparked entirely new
conceptions of art. We will then look at the Socialist Realist style of the Stalin era, Soviet dissident art and Moscow conceptualism, ending the semester with an exploration of
current trends in post-Soviet Russian art.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, two 5- to 8-page papers, and a final 10-page paper or exam.

This tutorial will focus on Lev Tolstoy’s four novelistic masterpiece—War and Peace, Anna Karenina, Resurrection, and Hadji Murat—placing them in their appropriate historical, social, and philosophical context. For each week of class, students will read a significant portion of a novel by Tolstoy, as well as a selection of secondary literature taken from
those works that inspired the author, reactions that arose at the time of the novel’s publication, and scholarship that seeks to explain the power and enduring significance of these
novels. Students will meet with the professor in pairs, with one student writing a five-page paper for each class session and the other student providing a critique of the paper. For
those students without Russian language skills, all works will be read in English translation. For those students who have completed at least three years of college-level Russian,
all primary readings, a significant portion of secondary readings, discussion, and writing assignments will be completed in Russian.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on completion of weekly reading and writing assignments and active discussion during tutorial sessions.
Prerequisites: for students taking the tutorial in English: none; for students taking the tutorial in Russian: either RUSS 252 or the permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10

RUSS 331T(S) The Brothers Karamazov (Same as COMP331T and ENGL 371T) (W)
Widely hailed as one of the greatest novels ever written, Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov contains a series of enigmas, not the least of which is precisely who murdered the
Karamazov father. In addition to exploring the shared guilt of all four of the brothers Karamazov in the crime of patricide, Dostoevsky poses the most probing questions of his
day: Are families tied together merely by blood or by deeper spiritual bonds? Is religious faith possible in an age of reason, science, and technology? Can man’s earthly laws ever
carry out divine justice? Is humanity prepared to bear the burden of responsibility that comes with freedom? This tutorial will spend an entire semester exploring Dostoevsky’s
masterwork, and we will read a variety of secondary sources alongside The Brothers Karamazov, including history, philosophy, and literary theory. Our goal will be to understand
Dostoevsky’s answers to these so–called “accursed questions” through the unique artistic form of The Brothers Karamazov.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: based on completion of weekly reading and writing assignments, as well as active engagement during tutorial sessions.
Prerequisites: at least one 200–level literature class. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to students majoring or considering a major in Russian, Comparative

RUSS 343(F) Spectacles on His Nose and Autumn on his Heart: The Oeuvre of Isaac Babel (Same as COMP 343, JWST 343 and INST 343) (W) (D)
Known alternately as “master of the short story” and “Russian Maupassant,” Isaac Babel was not only one of the most celebrated and intriguing authors of early Soviet Russia,
but also a cultural figure of profound national and international significance. For a number of reasons (political, aesthetic, professional, ethical) Babel was not prolific and this will
allow us to read almost all of his creative output, something we rarely get to do in the course of a single semester. Babel’s writing is extremely varied—it includes sketches,
journalistic prose, short stories, plays, movie scripts, one unfinished novel—and richly intertextual. This will afford us the opportunity to read the work of some of his contemporaries and predecessors, from both Russia and abroad, with whom he fashioned brilliant literary conversations, among them Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, Sholem
Aleichem, and Ivan Turgenev. Babel saw self–definition as the core of his writing and as an EDI offering, this course will ask students to reflect on what it meant to be a Russian,
a Jew, and a non–party author–an outsider, insider, and problematic hybrid rolled into one—in the highly unsettled, and unsettling, 1920s and 1930s. All course readings will be in

RUSS 401(F) Senior Seminar: Representations of the Caucasus in Russian Literature and Film (W)
Media coverage of the recent Chechen wars and terrorists acts in Moscow has exposed the troubled relationship between Russia and the Caucasus, a conflict that is hundreds of
years old. Over the past two centuries, Russian writers and filmmakers have addressed this tension in central works of poetry, prose, and film. This course offers a survey of the
most emblematic representations of the Caucasus in Russian cultural productions of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. We will focus on literary works by Pushkin, Lermontov,
Tolstoy, Esenin, Mayakovsky, Pristavkin, Pelevin, and Politkovskaya, and will analyze a number of relevant films—Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (1966); The Color of Pomegranates (1968); Prisoner of the Caucasus (1996); War (2002); and Aleksandra (2007). We will strive to investigate how the Russian writers and filmmakers have used the
image of the Caucasian Other to address the issue of Russia’s self–representation, and to what degree contemporary Russian artists have transformed the image of the Caucasians
compared to the Romantic period. The course will be conducted entirely in Russian. All readings and viewings will be in Russian.
Format: seminar. Requirements: consist of four short essays, a conference–style presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Russian 251, 252 or consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 4). Preference given to Russian Majors.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Advisory Committee: Professors: ALTSCHULER, D. BEAVER, DETHIER, KAPLAN, THOMAN. Associate Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and Technology Studies also examines
their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists
and engineers, possess any understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interactions that direct change in either
science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these questions by providing a
broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which examine the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the
economics of research and development and technological change, science and public policy, technology assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and
ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are
chosen from the list of designated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American studies, philosophy, history of
science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of science, or philosophy. The sixth
course necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science in addition to the College’s three-course science requirement. Other science courses of
particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the program. Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall
of their junior year.

Chair, Professor DAVID EPPEL
Professors: BAKER-WHITE***. Associate Professors: HOLZAPFEL, SANGARE. Assistant Professor: MORRIS. Lecturers: BROTHERS, CATALANO.
As a reflection of the theatre’s historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have
informed theatrical endeavor. The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty of the Language, Literature,

276

Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on
stage, the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as continued participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as
laboratory and experimental productions of all kinds are mounted on the new stages of the ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting or technical work is open to
all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses
and production participation that will constitute their major.

MAJOR
The Major in Theatre consists of nine courses.
Six required courses are:
Theatre 101(F) Introduction to Theatre
Theatre 103(S) Acting I
Theatre 201 Theatrical Staging and Design: The Collaborative Process
Theatre 244 Introduction to Theatre Technology (formerly THEA 102)
Theatre 248 The Modern Theatre: Plays and Performance
Theatre 406 Senior Seminar
Three elective courses must be taken from the department’s other offerings. Potential majors in Theatre are strongly advised to take an elective course in the department that
culminates in departmental production. Substitutions of other Williams’ courses, or of Study Abroad courses, will be made only with the consent of the department Chair.
Students should consult with the department Chair regularly in planning a balance of practice and scholarship in their elective choices.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of four department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement
for Theatre 244. Participation in at least two of the four must be in technical production and one of those two must be in stage management. Assignment to productions is
normally made in consultation with the department Chair.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Department Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their
proposed project. The portfolio will be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the major. This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes taken in other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and production credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least
three papers or samples of other written work, and might also include design projects, director’s notebooks, studio art projects, actor’s journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate’s work. For students who have taken a semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of approximately twelve dramatic or critical texts the student has read, and that he or she feels have had
particular relevance in his or her Theatre education to date. Annotations should be based upon a particular angle of engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas
that the student has chosen to emphasize in his or her theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a designer, a director, a
playwright, or a dramaturg. Generally annotations should be one or two paragraphs long.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being submitted. Students should look for connections between the various
aspects of their work, state any theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their educational goals for their
work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student’s record and his or her project description; a determination will then be made as to admission into the Honors program.
Students intending to apply for Honors should meet with the Department Chair or designated Honors Coordinator by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a
student is admitted to the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor, who will work with the student to specify a timeline and work program
for the completion of the Honors Project. At a minimum, this will entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course offered either within the department or
elsewhere that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contributing specifically to the overall goals of the honors work. This honors elective may not fulfill any other portion
of the Theatre Major, or any other major the student may be pursuing. All honors candidates will present their completed projects to the Department Honors Committee for
evaluation.

STUDY ABROAD
The Theatre Department attempts to work individually with majors and prospective majors who desire to study abroad. In general, with careful planning it is usually quite easy
for students to complete the major in Theatre if they study abroad for one semester of their junior year. For those wishing to study abroad for more than one semester of junior
year, a more complicated situation may arise, but one that can often be successfully managed through close consultation with the department chair. Students are encouraged to
consult with the chair early in their Williams careers if they anticipate a combination of Theatre major and study abroad.
THEA 101(F) Introduction to Theatre (Same as COMP 151) (D)
This introductory course serves as a general gateway to the study of Theatre. The course investigates principal areas of Theatre practice, including the Play and Playwright, Actor,
Director, Designer, Audience, and Company. Through lectures, class discussions, performance practice, and hands-on laboratory sessions, students will encounter dramatic texts
and theatrical contexts from a variety of traditions around the globe. Dramatists covered may include: Sophocles, Shakespeare, Zeami, Molière, Chekhov, Beckett, and Parks.
Students are expected to complete reading and writing assignments, as well as to participate in practical projects in the labs. This course is open to all and welcomes non-Theatre
majors. For students interested in the Theatre major, this course fulfills a primary requirement and should be taken during one’s first or second year. This course meets the
Exploring Diversity distinction because it engages in both a comparative and empathetic study of a broad range of theatrical cultures, examining their unique histories and
appreciating their diverse artistries.

This introductory critical survey course will explore a variety of theatre and performance traditions from around the globe, from antiquity to the present day. Through close
analysis of select texts and performance practices in a seminar format, the course will consider what role theatre plays in the establishment and growth of culture, politics, and
aesthetics. Topics may include: Ancient Greek theatre, Classical Indian performance, Renaissance English theatre, Japanese Noh and Kabuki, popular American traditions,
modern European theatre, and postmodern performance. Films and other media will be utilized when relevant. Regular in-class visits to the Williams College Museum of Art
will occur, as well. This course meets the criteria of the Exploring Diversity Initiative as it engages in a cross-cultural investigation of performance and explores how theatre is
deeply embedded in power relations.
Format: lecture/seminar. Requirements: 5 structured writing and creative assignments based on thematic elements of the course, as well as a final “Company“ performance;
in-class participation, writing, and discussion; participation in all LABS; all students enrolled in the course are also required to attend the departmental theatre productions.

This course examines the designer’s and director’s creative process and collaborative roles in the creation of theater. Over a series of practical projects in staging and mise-enscene, as well as scenic, costume, and lighting design we will try different techniques for eliciting an initial creative response to a text, developing that response into a point-ofview, and solving the practical needs of the production. Particular emphases will be placed on how directors and designers work together to imagine the fictional world(s) of
theatrical productions, how design elements synthesize with one another, with the work of the actors and director, and with the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context

277

of the work as a whole. The course will be team-taught with the dual perspectives of directing and design prompting students to adopt various creative roles throughout the series
of assigned projects. Basic presentation skills and technique, as well as methodologies for critical feedback, will be taught as crucial elements of staging and design development.

THEA 205 The Culture of Carnival (Same as COMP 208) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Carnival is a regenerative festival as well as a transgressive one. It is a time for upheavals and recreating for one day, a new world order. Men dress as women, women dress as
men, the poor become kings; drink and sex and outrageous behavior is sanctioned. We will look at festivals in such places as New Orleans, Venice, and Rio. Central to this course
are the cultural and religious lives of these societies, and how these festivals exist politically in a modern world as theatre and adult play. A variety of sources will be used, such as
newspaper accounts, films, photography, personal memoirs and essays on the subject.
Students will be evaluated on regular active class participation, one oral presentation including a, 5-page essay, one 15-page research final paper and participation in a group

THEA 228 Theatrical Self-Production: The Cartographic Imagination (Not offered 2013-2014)
In today’s theater world, self-production can be a vital, engaging, and necessary method of creating and producing theatrical works. This course examines theatrical self-production and the ways in which artists exploit this model in pursuit of their individual and collective ambitions. Through an examination of innovative, non-traditional models for
performance creation, this class will form its own unique structure for developing and producing a new theatrical performance for public presentation. Operating within carefully
chosen constraints, students will share equally the administrative, artistic, and production roles in the public presentation of their work on stage. Thus, a major emphasis of the
course will be on experiential education, which provides an invaluable opportunity to encounter firsthand the highly complex relationship between artistry and production. To
best advise and mentor students in all levels of design, direction and performance, the course will include additional guest classes with practitioners from the profession, as well as
the Department of Theater who can help to provide the full range of skills necessary for students to realize their goals. Group presentations of the creative development process
will provide opportunities for guidance, critique, and sustained mentorship on the path to a final performance. This year, 228 will investigate the performance possibilities contained in the idea of The Map, and in the act of mapping space and spatial relationships.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: Students will contribute to the creation of a final performance piece by the group as a whole. Grading will be based on committed class participation, contribution to the collective work of the class, group and individual presentations, and self-evaluation.
No prerequisites; students from a broad range of curricular disciplines are welcome, but some prior experience in theatre or theatre studies in preferable. Enrollment limited: 16
(expected: 12). Upon overenrollment, the instructors will seek to balance the course by level of prior theatrical experience.

THEA 236 Political Theatre Making (Not offered 2013-2014)
Placing twentieth-century theatricality in the context of its historical roots in Western theatre, this course will examine a broad range of types of protest movements. From the
biting observations of the British class system by playwrights such as Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, and John Osborne, to mid-century American political writers such as Clifford
Odets and Edward Albee, and Italy’s Dario Fo, to the relentless satire of contemporary South African performers such as Pieter Dirk-Uys, we will investigate dramatic writing
and performance style as aspects of social and political resistance. Other groups studied may include the protest theatre of Johannesburg’s Market Theatre, Luiz Valdez’s Teatro
Campesino, and a younger generation of post-apartheid experimentation in multi-ethnic South African theatre.
Format: seminar. Requirements: semester-length research project, including a substantial paper, based on the hypothetical creation of a theatre company within specific historical,
social, and political contexts.

THEA 243T Strategies of Political Theatre (Not offered 2013-2014) (W)
“Change the world; it needs it,” is the German playwright Bertolt Brecht’s famous clarion cry. In this tutorial, we will take a critical look at the strategies employed in the
twentieth century by several dramatists who have attempted to heed Brecht’s exhortation. After a brief glance at Aristophanes and Shakespeare to correct any possible mistaken
impression that political theatre is a twentieth-century invention, the class will proceed, of course, to the plays and essays of Brecht himself (and his predecessor Erwin Piscator).
Students will read Brecht’s Mother Courage on war; The Measures Taken on political morality; Peter Weiss’ Marat/ Sade on revolution and The Investigation on the Holocaust;
Marc Blitzstein’s The Cradle Will Rock on corruption and corporate greed; Arthur Miller’s The Crucible on modern “witchhunts;” Harold Pinter’s The Birthday Party, Mountain
Language, The New World Order, and One for the Road on torture; Athol Fugard’s Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act on Apartheid; Barbara Garson’s MacBird on Vietnam; Caryl Churchill’s Cloud Nine on gender and sexuality; and Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 on race in America. With these plays and
associated essays, the tutorial will focus on a critical appraisal of the works in their dramatic design, as artful political commentary, and as calls to political action.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: In the first two weeks of the tutorial the class will meet together as a group to establish its bearings. Thereafter students will meet in pairs once a
week. Each student will write a 4- to 6-page paper every other week, and be prepared to mount a detailed comment/response in the alternate weeks. The focus will be both on
interpretative skills in reading dramatic texts, and on the ability to construct critical arguments and respond to them. A final project that can take the form of a performance piece, a
playtext, or a paper on a major American performance ensemble devoted to political drama is required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10). Open to sophomores and upperclassmen.

THEA 325T(S) A Room that Pretends to be Another Room: Scenography in Theory and Practice
How have designers and directors thought about theatrical space? How successfully have their theories aligned with their practice? How are the ideas of the great European and
American scenographers being re-imagined, reused, or abused on today’s stages? In this tutorial we will take a hybrid approach to the study of scenography, blending theoretical,
historical, and critical readings about stage design with a studio component that focuses on formulating an artistic response to those ideas. Our study of scenography will span a
hundred years from Robert Edmund Jones to Nature Theater of Oklahoma, examining the ideas of Josef Svoboda, Bertolt Brecht and Caspar Neher, Mielziner, Lee, and Conklin;
Wilson, Foreman, and The Wooster Group; and contemporary New York experimental theater. Assignments will alternate between writing short papers and creating preliminary
scenic designs; both done in response to the designers or periods being examined in the readings. Introductory drawing and/or some scale model-making experience would be
useful, but is not absolutely required.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on critical analysis and discussion of readings, and active participation in critiques of creative work. Assignments will consist of
response papers alternating with design projects that include visual research, sketches and/or scale models. There will be a final public presentation or display of all students’
work at the end of the semester.

THEA 339 Introduction to Dramaturgy: The Art of Classical Adaptation (Not offered 2013-2014)
The dramaturg is an important collaborator in the theatrical production process, playing the multi-faceted role of historian, cultural critic, audience educator, and overall supporter
of the production team. Working closely with the director, the dramaturg helps to shape a production and facilitate the demanding process of creating a world on stage. This
course will introduce students to the fundamentals of production dramaturgy, applying our study of the practice to the topic of classical adaptation and translation. Sophocles’
Antigone and Euripides’ Hippolytus will serve as two of our foundational texts, from which we’ll consider adaptations by Racine, Anouilh, Brecht, Gambaro, and LeCompte.
We’ll also view how modern directors have interpreted the classics through unique productions, such as Breuer’s The Gospel at Colonus, Brook’s Mahabharata, Mnouchkine’s
Les Atrides, and Ninagawa’s Medea.
Format: seminar. Requirements/Method of evaluation: Assignments will be project-based and will range from making image boards to writing program notes. As a final assignment, students will research and write their own mini-adaptations of classical works and present their material to one another through informal, staged readings.
Prerequisites: This course will serve as the Junior Seminar for majors in the Department of Theatre. Enrollment for non-majors is possible with permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference if over-enrolled: Required for majors and preference of instructor for non-majors

from the points of view of content, and context—that is the relationship between the performer and the work, and between the performer and the audience. The course will
culminate in a performance during the Theatre Department’s annual Dialogue One Festival. Students will identify an historical figure on which to base their final monologues,
and the work will entail intensive study of that person.
Prerequisite: THEA 103 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Theatre majors

directors of our recent past and present moment? This seminar course will consider both experimental and mainstream drama and performance from the past twenty years,
focusing on topics such as: auteur-directors, new realism, identity theatre, environmental theatre, performance art, cyber-plays, and the “virtuosic theatre” of the new century.
Artists to be considered may include: The Wooster Group, Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Rachel Rosenthal, Caryl Churchill,
Mac Wellman, Tony Kushner, David Henry-Hwang, Suzan-Lori Parks, Sarah Kane, Richard Maxwell, Annie Baker, and others.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on written and dramaturgical-based assignments as well as in-class discussions and a creative writing and/or performance project.

THEA 346 To Be Or Not To Be: Theatrical Decision-making (Not offered 2013-2014)
In this advanced acting course, students will examine a wide range of motivations, decisions, mistakes, and consequences that dramatic characters encounter. Through discussions and analysis of selected play, students will find key moments that define tragedy, and will explore the ways in which characters change their behavior to resolve conflict.
How do characters respond to problems? Could they make better choices? What can we change about our own decision-making? How do we protect ourselves from mistakes?
Fundamental dilemmas will be examined through theory and improvisation. The results of our exploration will be presented in a final performance. This theatrical experience
will prepare students for future challenges on the stage of life.
Format: studio. Requirements: evaluation will be based on committed participation in class, and preparation and performance of assigned material.

THEA 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
THEA 406(F) Senior Seminar: Special Feelings: Empathy, Intimacy, and Affect in Performance
This seminar course is required of all senior Theatre majors. The course is a revolving topics seminar. The subject matter and reading list for each iteration of the course will be
determined by the instructor, but will in each instance focus on a current or historical question of theatre theory and practice. It is understood that the subjects addressed in the
course will be broad enough to engage the varied interests of each senior class. The specific requirements for the class may vary, but in all cases students will be required to
present original research and analysis in a public seminar presentation at the end of the semester.
For Fall 2013, the senior seminar will explore the topic of empathy and affect in contemporary art, theatre, and performance. In childhood, we are encouraged to express how we
“feel” about art, but once we reach adulthood we are told to stifle our range of emotions and senses: “Look, but don’t touch!” Yet, feelings remain. So: why do we have “special
feelings” about some works of art and not others? How do paintings, sculptures, installations, plays, and performances, strive to “affect” us? This interdisciplinary senior seminar
will examine works of art that engage both our feelings and senses in empathic ways. What makes a performance reach us? What makes an experience in theatre “intimate”?
We’ll read Aristotle on “catharsis,” Heidegger on “moods,” and Tomkins on “affect,” as well as writings by Gilles Deleuze, Eve Sedgwick, Brian Massumi, Susan Leigh Foster,
Kathleen Stewart, Sianne Ngai, and Lauren Berlant. Artists/groups covered may include: Samuel Beckett, Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons, Mike Kelley, Marina Abramovic, Sarah
Kane, Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, Cindy Sherman, Elevator Repair Service, Marie-Virgnie Berbet, and many others.
Students will write on and compose oral responses to the material addressed each week, conducting personal research and working towards the completion of an independent

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers additional theatre study through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully
accredited by Connecticut College and is a member of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams students can therefore be selected to take a full semester of
intensive theatre study at the NTI, located at the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford, Connecticut. During the semester, students from participating colleges
live and work as members of a theatre company gaining experience with professional theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early application is essential.

WOMEN’S, GENDER and SEXUALITY STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor LUCIE SCHMIDT
Advisory Committee: Professors: BUELL*, DRUXES, C. JOHNSON, KENT*. Associate Professors: CEPEDA**, DUBOW*, HOLZAPFEL, MARTIN,
SCHMIDT. Visiting Associate Professor: HONDERICH§. Assistant Professors: COOK, R. MANIGAULT-BRYANT, MITCHELL. Lecturer: GUTSCHOW§.
Visiting Assistant Professor: COWDEN. Librarian: SHRIVER. Queer Life Coordinator: ADKINS. Health Educator: DENELLI-HESS.
Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so
on, how gender affects the experiences and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge and experience. Scholarship in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies has brought neglected material into established fields and raised important methodological questions that cross disciplinary
boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines
that focus in a coherent way on gender issues, and/or sexuality issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the field.

THE MAJOR
The Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies major encourages students’ exposure to the interdisciplinary character of feminist and sexuality-focused scholarship. In addition,
majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a field or discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity
(racial, sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender and sexuality, to gain exposure to feminist and/or queer theory, and to pursue work at an advanced level (3
courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With
the advisor, the student will establish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should contact the chair of the Program
(Schmidt, x3143).

Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
WGSS 101 Introduction to Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies
WGSS 402 Junior/Senior Seminar in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies (The seminar explores topics in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and varies from year
to year. Majors may take more than one seminar, space permitting.)

Students can check with the department coordinator to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies
Honors in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate completes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of the
work, and is awarded honors by the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of
presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, theater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies after the following criteria are met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Committee approval of a 4- to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general
methodology, and preliminary bibliography for the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named; prior to submission of this proposal, students must consult with a
reference librarian.
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and second reader of a 5- to 10-page “Plan of Action” (an overview of what
has already been completed and a schedule of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students pursuing honors will continue to consult
with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors; the
advisor will award the grade(s)

STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Program encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance their education and gain international
perspectives on gender and women’s issues and feminism. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them
cultural immersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. There are several semester-long programs with a
specific focus on women and/or gender administered by other U.S. Colleges that would especially enrich the educational experience of our majors:
Antioch College: Comparative Women’s Studies in Europe fall semester
Augsburg College, Center for Global Education: Crossing Borders: Gender and Social Change in Mesoamerica fall semester; and Social and Environmental Justice in Latin
America spring semester
School for International Training:
The Balkans: Women and Democratization, fall or spring semester
Jamaica: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
Mali: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
The Netherlands: Identity, Gender and Sexuality, fall or spring semester

CROSS-LISTED COURSES (INCLUDING SEQUENCE COURSES)
WGSS 101(F,S) Introduction to Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies (W) (D)
This discussion and lecture course introduces students to a range of issues, theories, and controversies within feminism, gender studies, and sexuality studies. It has several aims:
to provide critical and analytical tools for thinking about gender; to explore key issues facing women and sexual minorities in the U.S. (and other) societies, and to discuss
strategies for confronting them. The course will examine issues such as: body politics, sexuality, reproductive rights, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family,
homophobia, transgendered people’s experiences in the US and abroad. Above all, the course is intended as an exploration of the tremendous diversity of thought contained
under the general rubrics of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies and as a vehicle for developing skills in writing and research, as well as analytical tools for further work in the
field. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that its main emphases are on challenging the notion of one universalizing category of “woman,”
and to recognize the diverse ways in which national, sexual, ethnic, racial, classed and other kinds of differences produce multiple and often divergent relations of gendered
power. It also whenever possible contextualizes within a global frame the central issues that have made up and continue to define the U.S. feminist tradition, in order to encourage
students to recognize the role cultural difference plays in a variety of feminist issues and to decenter the U.S as a reference point for all feminist theory and politics. During days

WGSS 202(F) Introduction to Sexuality Studies (D)
This course will offer an introduction to the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender/queer studies, in part through examining historical, legal,
literary, filmic, cultural studies, sociological, and popular texts, as well as work done under the umbrella of queer theory. Subjects covered may include the following: histories of
sexualities in the U.S., feminism and its relation to queer studies; how sexuality is racialized; transgender and intersex theory and activism; globalization and sexuality; and
strategies of resistance and visibility such as those evidenced by AIDS activism/theory and debates over gay marriage. An essential part of the course will be exploring how race,
class, religion, and nationality contribute to the construction and lived experience of modern gender and sexual identities. Readings may include works by Foucault, Butler,
Sedgwick, Warner, Berlant, Stryker, Puar, Ferguson, Muñoz, Freeman, El-Tayeb, Halberstam, Crimp, Lorde, Najmabadi, and Massad. This class meets the requirements of the

WGSS 204 The Experience of Sexuality: Gender and Sexuality in 20th-century American Memoirs (Same as COMP 244) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
Focusing on first-person accounts of LGBTQ sexualities, this course examines how changing social and political realities have affected sexual desires and identities, and how
individuals represent their experiences of these historical and conceptual shifts. How do these representations of sexuality challenge prevailing ideas about desire and identity?
How do they navigate the gender limitations imposed by our language? How do other social identifications, such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, shape these experiences of
sexuality? We will read memoirs, autobiographies, and personal essays that reflect a range of LGBTQ identities and experiences, including works by Martin Duberman, Audre
Lorde, Leslie Feinberg, Alison Bechdel, Reinaldo Arenas, Kate Bornstein, Gloria Anzaldúa, Samuel Delany, David Wojnarowicz, and Michelle Tea. These narratives will be
accompanied by a variety of queer and feminist theories of sexuality, some of which interrogate the historical and conceptual limitations of “experience” and “identity.” This
course fulfills the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that it investigates institutions of power and privilege as they have impacted LGBTQ communities,
emphasizes empathetic understanding of gender and sexual diversity, and focuses on critical theorization of intersecting differences and identities.
Format: seminar. Requirements: intensive reading; active class participation; two 5-page papers and final 10-page paper.

WGSS 211 Gender in the Global Economy (Same as ECON 211) (Not offered 2013-2014)
This course will present a feminist economic analysis of the global economy, and some of the urgent issues facing women in poor countries. The course will start by developing
theoretical resources: these will include feminist critiques of economics theory, work on care labor and the shifting boundaries between markets, governments and households,
theories of household bargaining, and discussions of intersectionality and difference. Then we will discuss a series of interlinked issues which may include the contradictory
effects of structural adjustment and its successors; the informal sector and the ’invisible assembly line’; the economics of sex work and global sex trafficking; microcredit; the
economics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We will finish by looking at community-based activism, non-governmental organizations, and the possibilities for first-world/thirdworld alliances.
Requirements: reaction papers, midterm exam, research paper; participation in class discussion will count for part of the grade; two oral responses to seminar papers; two 2-page
seminar response papers; one response to a peer’s final paper.

WGSS 230(F) Gender, Sexuality, and Global HIV/AIDS (Same as AFR 230) (D)
The global pandemic of HIV/AIDS is now entering into its fourth decade. Throughout this history sexuality, gender and race and inequality have played a central role in the
spread of the virus, and its apparent entrenchment in certain communities. This class will use a gendered, interdisciplinary perspective to investigate the pandemic’s social,
economic and political causes, impact, and conundrums—the problems it poses for scholarship, activism, public policy, and public health. Issues discussed will include the role
of transaction sex and economic structures in both susceptibility to HIV and vulnerability to its impact; stigma and its challenges for HIV prevention, testing and treatment
uptake; the role of positive youth in the next stages of the pandemic; and the evolving expressions of biopower in the global AIDS response. The class will look at examples of
successful policies and activism as well as the failures, corruption and complacency that have characterized the global pandemic. There will be a particular geographical focus on
experiences in the U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. The class is an EDI course because of its focus on diversity and difference, as they shape the different ways that the HI virus plays
out on the bodies of people in different global locations, and its discussion of the ways that global and local contexts of colonialism. patriarchy, and heteronormativity have
inevitably shaped relationships between policy makers, researchers, activists, and those living with HIV and ultimately the content of their policies and interventions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short papers and a research paper.; class participation will form part of the grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to WGSS majors, Public Health concentrators.

WGSS 240(F) Performing Masculinity in Global Popular Culture (Same as AMST 241 and LATS 241 and THEA 241) (D)
This course examines popular cultural contexts, asking what it means to be a man in contemporary societies. We focus on the manufacture and marketing of masculinity in
advertising, fashion, TV/film, theater, popular music, and the shifting contours of masculinity in everyday life, asking: how does political economy change the ideal shape,
appearance, and performance of men? How have products - ranging from beer to deodorant to cigarettes— had their use value articulated in gendered ways? Why must masculinity be the purview of “males” at all; how can we change discourses to better include performances of female masculinities, butch-identified women, and trans* men? We will
pay particular attention to racialized, queer, and subaltern masculinities. Some of our case studies include: the short half-life of the boy band in the US and in Asia (e.g., J/K-Pop),
hip hop masculinities at home and abroad, changing standards of masculinity in pornography (e.g., thug porn), a backwards glance at 18th c. fads for eunuch opera singers, and

283

the curious blend of chastity and homoeroticism that constitutes masculinity in the contemporary vampire genre. Through these and other examples, we learn to recognize
masculinity as a performance shaped by the political economy of a given culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: masculinity scrapbook and journal, mid-term essay, final paper proposal, 8- to 10-page final paper, short field trip reaction essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to WGSS majors; American Studies majors; Theatre majors; Latina/o Studies majors; juniors/seniors;

WGSS 306 Queer of Color Critique (Same as AFR 306, AMST 306, COMP 304 and LATS 306) (Not offered 2013-2014) (D)
This advanced seminar introduces students to queer of color critique, a mode of queer theory emphasizing diverse experiences, geographies, and epistemologies that also
foregrounds the intersection of sexual and racial constructs. We will examine the history of this line of critique, exploring how and why it became a necessary intervention into
the then still emerging field of queer studies. In addition to theoretical works, we also examine literary and cinematic works that exemplify and enact queer of color critique.
We will read major works by those individuals who established the discipline, thereby surveying works from a variety of fields including critical race studies, literary theory,
anthropology, feminist/womanist studies, ethnic studies, postcolonial studies, area studies, and others. Much of this early work in queer of color critique is North American in
context, but we will also explore more recent scholarship that deals with transnational contexts and applications and examine how queer of color critique contributed to the
emergence of transnational queer studies. A key feature of this course will be its uniquely dialogic structure that will allow a variety of diverse authors and artists to appear
virtually to answer questions about their published work as well as some emerging scholars in the field who will share their experiences finding their way into this area of study
and how they developed research and artistic projects. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that it focuses on empathetic understanding,
power and privilege, and critical theorization, especially in relation class, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity in both the US and global comparative contexts.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: attendance at first meeting is mandatory, participation, online forum, three short papers synthesizing readings and course materials,
and a final research paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to WGSS majors and students considering a WGSS major.

WGSS 402(S) Global Sex: Identities, Migration, Globalization (D)
This course reveals how different cultures construct sexual identities, and what happens when dominant paradigms (i.e. the Euro-American LGBT model) become enmeshed in
globalization, capitalism, and consumerism. Why do we find gay bears and drag queens trafficking in North American iconography flourishing in countries like Brazil and South
Africa? Why does Madonna still turn out gay crowds in Indonesia and Russia? As global gay culture spreads, what happens to people with their own local conceptions of
gender/sexuality (e.g., “Two Spirit” Native Americans?) How have free trade and the internet transformed queer lives, queer sex, and people’s understandings of their sexual
selves? We begin with a focus on alternative gender/sexual formations around the world. Next we ask what happens when it‘s not only identities that are on the move, but actual
bodies. Here, we focus on queer diasporas, refugees, and migrants. Our final unit brings us into the global flows of capitalism itself to interrogate the role of consumerism in
sexual culture, tackling thorny issues of gay gentrification, tourism, pinkwashing/homonationalism, global gay cinematic representations, and the neocolonial potential of NGOs.
Ultimately, this class reveals that sexuality is infused in global economic and political affairs in ways that are often overlooked.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Comparative Class Presentation, Mid–term essay, Project proposal/abstract, final paper, field trip reaction paper.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions, and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks
to promote and facilitate an exchange of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The program offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching, workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate in a
variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning geared to those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists.

285

We seek to connect students with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum so that students can see the vital
connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is
open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested student might take
 PSYC 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
 PSYC 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
 PSYC 242 Social Psychology;
 PSYC 272 Psychology of Education;
 PSYC 327 Optimizing Learning and Memory
 PSYC 336 Adolescence;
 PSYC 372
Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
 At least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berkshire County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC),
although other opportunities may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program—although some lend themselves easily to certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history,
or French, almost all of our majors can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a concentration of courses in a different field,

WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Director, Professor KATIE KENT
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long program of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the
University. Williams students will be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University, eligible for access to virtually all of its
facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world’s great universities.
Although students on the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall,
and join all College clubs and organizations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams House, a compound of four buildings
owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city centre. Up to six students from Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams House each year,
responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and the University. A resident director (and member of the Williams faculty) administers
Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic program, and serves as both the primary academic and personal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students on the Williams-Exeter Programme are required to be in residence in Oxford from Thursday, 3 October 2013, until at least 22 June 2014 with two breaks for vacations between the three terms. Students enroll for the full academic year, which consists of three eight-week terms of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM (13 October to 7
December 2013), HILARY TERM (19 January to 15 March 2014), and TRINITY TERM (20 April to 21 June 2014). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first
tutorial papers in the week (0th Week) before the eight weeks of instruction begin and to remain in residence during the week (9th Week) after the term ends in order to sit final
examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening five week vacations, during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials. Students are required to arrive in Oxford by 3 October 2013 for the ten-day orientation.

THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and
discuss an essay they have written, based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the beginning of each term. In addition
to the weekly tutorial, students are usually expected to attend a course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for
Visiting Students at Exeter College, the director, working closely with Exeter’s subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor student progress, be in regular
contact with the student’s tutors, supervise the examinations that students sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student’s academic progress to the Senior Tutor
at Exeter College. There are no “add/drop” periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial course, and the director has then secured a tutor to
teach that course, students cannot back out or change the terms of the tutorial. All tutorials at Oxford are graded, although in exceptional circumstances a tutorial may be converted to pass/fail before the end of the fourth week of term with the permission of the Programme director.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FIVE tutorial courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and generally
requiring the preparation of eight essays). It is possible for students, in consultation with their tutor, to spread an eight-session tutorial out over two terms, however. Although
some students take the minimum five tutorial courses, most have enrolled in two tutorials per term for a total of six tutorials over their time at Oxford.

GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight tutorial sessions, including their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final
examination. Final examinations last three hours and are always sat in the ninth week of term, following the eight weeks of instruction. For some tutorial courses, tutors may elect
to offer the student the option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University, students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic
year, with each eight-session tutorial plus final examination counting as the equivalent of 1.6 regular semester courses taken at Williams. Grades eventually become a part of their
Williams transcript and will be included in the computation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no
more than one from each division, for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College “Writing Intensive” designation, except for those in the studio arts,
mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department
policy.

THE COURSE OF STUDY
In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Commonwealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which Oxford is particularly noted (Economics, English Literature, Modern History, Philosophy, Politics, Classics, Theology, the Natural Sciences, etc.). Exeter College also has fellows in English Language and Literature (with interests ranging from the Renaissance-including Shakespeare-to the early nineteenth century), in Politics (with interests in international relations and
comparative politics), and in History (with an interest in the medieval period) committed to teaching Williams students, and students are thus encouraged to consider undertaking
at least one tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a PARTIAL list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below represent
a selection of some of the standard “papers” (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in tutorial format, although most are not offered
every Oxford term. It needs to be emphasized that this is only a partial list, that the tutorial offerings at Oxford University are incredibly rich, and that one of the attractions of the
Programme is that it enables students to define, develop, and pursue their academic interests. Students are therefore encouraged to explore all the courses offered at Oxford even if
they are not listed in this Catalog.
Tutorial courses are not offered every term and are often accompanied by scheduled lectures. Although the term in which the lectures are delivered is sometimes listed below,
as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-Hilary Term; TT-Trinity Term), these change from year to year. It is therefore imperative that
students consult the relevant “faculty” webpages to make sure when the lectures and/or tutorials they wish to take are actually offered. Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.

descriptions are provided below, detailed descriptions of all the courses listed in this catalog can be found on the websites of respective departments or faculties the links of which
can be found at: http://www.ox.ac.uk/divisions/department_az.html. For a full list of lectures in all divisions at the university, visit: http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/pubs/lectures/

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. The Programme normally subsidizes such study.

STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University-and full members of Exeter College-Williams students are offered every
opportunity to become fully integrated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional variety of sports clubs, debating
societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtually all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged
to participate fully in the social life of Exeter College-to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the College bar, to use the College’s athletic facilities, and to become
members of the various College clubs and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to the University’s athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions,
museums, and libraries. All Williams students in Oxford are encouraged to join the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining
facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in large double rooms and enjoy full access to the House’s library, common rooms, laundry facilities,
computer lab, and a large dining room, in which a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small kitchens in the House that
students may use. The entire facility has high-speed wireless internet access. Bedrooms are hard wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped with furnishings, bed
linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard, sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs are available during the academic year
for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to maintain the facilities and organize Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus ride
(or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy walking distance of the University parks and the local shops, restaurants and banks of
Summertown. The Programme will partially subsidize student bus passes to facilitate travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins—on Sunday, 13 October 2013—ten days of orientation activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many
activities, some of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will become acquainted with the workings of the Programme, of
Exeter College, and of the University, and will be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Oxford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a few of sites of historical, cultural, or political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds,
Salisbury, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the opportunity to attend a
number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford’s proximity to London gives students ready access to that city’s multiple attractions and many resources. The
Oxford-London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even more regularly (and are generally cheaper), and the one-way
journey takes about ninety minutes.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks,
policies, and procedures of the Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling year in and around Oxford.

ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health
insurance policy). While in Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Medical Practice used by Exeter College and for
emergency hospital treatment. The Programme also works with a physician in private practice attached to a local private hospital. Prescription drugs are available through the
NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services available through the NHS and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at the
University, Williams students are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling, however, would need to be covered by the
student’s personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical services received in foreign countries, especially those
countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.

FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same as those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for arranging and funding the cost of their air travel to and from Britain, although
they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive rates. They are provided with three meals a day for the first four or five days in
Oxford and with a weekly catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the week at
Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Oxford, but they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning
purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the
usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be
expected. Since the academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one half and the
difference will be made up by additional Williams aid.

APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean’s Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior
to applying, should consult with the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Oxford can also be raised with the director of
the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal application form, students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to complete an
application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are subject to approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be notified of
acceptance before Spring Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the College’s distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. In making its
decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA into account, with a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0,
expects all applicants to have demonstrated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to
provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at least one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant’s writing ability.

WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA A. GILBERT (Williams College), GLENN S. GORDINIER (Mystic Seaport Museum; University of
Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport Museum); MARY K. BERCAW–EDWARDS (University of Connecticut; Mystic Seaport Museum), RICHARD J. KING (Mystic Seaport Museum).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to explore the ocean, travel the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, and
undertake original research of their own design in the humanities and sciences. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors of all majors welcome. A term at Williams-Mystic includes
credit for one semester plus one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanographic Processes (see the Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast,
and a Louisiana field seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary exercises. The Fall 2013 semester will include a field seminar to the Hawaiian Islands.
Students live in historic, cooperative, co-ed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world’s largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime
library, a state-of-the-art Marine Sciences teaching and research center, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments,
ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial
navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling
academic environment. No sailing experience necessary. Participation in Williams-Mystic can also be used in partial fulfillment of the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested students should email admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (http://mystic.williams.edu/), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog
from the Dean’s office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean’s office.

EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE
THE EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE REQUIREMENT—Williams College is committed to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty, and student body that
reflects and explores a diverse, globalized world and the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses designated “(D)” in the College Bulletin are a part of the
College’s Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI); they represent our dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as they interact with, and challenge, each other.
Through such courses, students and faculty also consider the multiple approaches that engage these issues. Rather than simply focus on the study of specific peoples,
cultures, or regions of the world, in the past or present, however, courses fulfilling the requirement actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with diversity. They urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and provide them with the tools to do so. The ultimate aim of the requirement is to lay the
groundwork for a life-long engagement with the diverse cultures, societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of the world.
Courses that comprise the Exploring Diversity Initiative may fall under a variety of categories, including (but not limited to) the following:

1. Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies. These courses focus on the differences and similarities between cultures and societies, and/or on the ways in which cultures,
peoples, and societies have interacted and responded to one another in the past.
2. Empathetic Understanding. These courses explore diverse human feelings, thoughts, and actions by recreating the social, political, cultural, and historical context of a
group in order to imagine why within that context, those beliefs, experiences, and actions of the group emerged.
3. Power and Privilege: These courses link issues of diversity to economic and political power relations, investigating how cultural interaction is influenced by various structures, institutions, or practices that enable, maintain, or mitigate inequality among different groups.
4. Critical Theorization: These courses focus on ways scholars theorize the possibilities of cross-cultural understanding and interaction; they investigate the ways that disciplines and paradigms of knowledge both constitute “difference” and are reconfigured by the study of diversity-related questions.
5. Cultural Immersion: In various ways these courses immerse students in another culture and give them the tools with which to understand that culture from the inside. They
include those foreign language courses that explicitly engage in the self-conscious awareness of cultural and societal differences, traditions, and customs as an integral
aspect of language study.
All students are required to complete ONE course that is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional
distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.
By immersing students in foreign cultures, and often by furthering language acquisition, study abroad programs can offer a robust way to study cultural diversity. Students
wishing to fulfill the EDI requirement via the completion of a study abroad program must submit a petition before departure proposing EDI credit for a particular course on
their program, for particular experiences (such as independent research or a homestay), or for a specific language training program they will undertake while abroad. The
petition will require students to describe how they believe their proposed study abroad experience will meet one or more of the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initiative; it
will be considered by the Director of the Exploring Diversity Initiative working in concert with the Committee on Academic Standing.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to
employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year, all students must satisfactorily
complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course—those marked with a “(Q). Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed
into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary
evaluation in these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2013-2014:

THE WILLIAMS TUTORIAL PROGRAM
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; they are usually given enrollment preference for such
courses, though interested juniors and seniors are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for juniors and seniors (and, often,
for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses—or even small seminars—on student participation. They aim to teach students how to
develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogently to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous
conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a description of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students. At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar, and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly
group meetings of all tutorial members to provide background information designed to facilitate the students’ independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a
report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to the assignment for that week, while the other student—and then the instructor—offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six
critiques of their partners’ work.
Since the program’s inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding—and rewarding—courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the same time, students have consistently placed
tutorials among the most enriching and consequential courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended implications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as
they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have
formed important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teachers.

Registration information: Students pre–register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but should first check the description for prerequisites
and to see if permission of the instructor is required). Because of limited enrollments and the special logistical arrangements involved in organizing tutorials, students may not drop a tutorial after 4:00 PM on the day before the first scheduled day of organizational meetings each semester. It is therefore
important that students determine, before the start of the term, their interest in and commitment to the course. If they are uncertain whether they wish to
take the tutorial, they should consult with the instructor. Tutorials may not be taken on a pass/fail basis.

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as “writing intensive”—those marked with a “(W)”—stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of
writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited
to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will
benefit most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of the
sophomore year.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2013-2014 academic year must register for WSP. Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are
registered for a senior thesis in the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration. First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they are not allowed to do
99’s.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration period, there are many things that can happen between registration and
the beginning of Winter Study to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a project with a larger enrollment, not that it
will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restrictions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this
Sustaining Program, so no one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out
of ten students will qualify. A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies that a student’s work has been significantly
lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than January 30, 2014. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.

WINTER STUDY 99’S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose “99’s,” independent projects arranged with faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses.
Perhaps you have encountered an interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have an interest not covered in the regular
curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic medical
clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99’s involve travel
away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Williamstown.
99 forms are available online: http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is September 26, 2013.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY
ANSO 10 Facebook in the Developing World: Boon or Bain?
Celebrity-led social media campaigns. Cell phone text donations. Spring break “voluntourism.” In the age of new social media, international development has shifted to support
these diverse and (some would say) innovative initiatives to mitigate the developing world’s woes. But are these initiatives effective? Using Haiti as a case study, this course will
look at the human rights and development literature to analyze the recent trends in international development (from student-led volunteering trips and Facebook campaigns to
celebrity-led non-profits and twitter donations). Students will then select a development issue of interest and either: critique or defend an already existing initiative that addresses
it; or craft an original social media tool (online campaign, civic engagement app, etc.). Students will be evaluated on their final projects (either a final report and presentation for
students who choose the first option or a proposal and presentation of the new tool for students who choose the second). Students will be expected to back up their final projects
with evidence from a variety of sources (extant literature, primary interviews with stakeholders in the U.S. development community, etc.). We will meet twice a week for threehour sessions, with extra supervised time scheduled as necessary.
Requirements: final written report and oral presentation.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost: $50 for books.
Meeting time: mornings.

ANSO 11 Berkshire Farm Internship
An experiential field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire Farm Center is a residential treatment program for adolescent
males with traumatic histories impacting their ability to function successfully in their home, school and community environment. The youth have either been remanded by the
Family Court System or placed through their School District for treatment and intervention. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic strata, are very ethnically
diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York State. The issues that bring them to placement are mainly a result of the psychological scars developed
from physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. The manifested behaviors include chemical dependency, juvenile delinquency, inability to function in the school setting, inability to
follow the rules at home, running away and/or mental health issues. The residential treatment model is strength based and focuses on teaching healthy decision making.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in various settings including school, cottage life, recreation, adventure-based therapy, animal
husbandry or individual tutoring. The students are responsible to be proactive in developing their learning experience.
Requirements: students will be responsible to coordinate transportation among their classmates (van licenses to secure a college van is recommended), keep a journal reflecting
on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with the instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final 10-page paper at the end of
the course or arrange a campus tour with the Berkshire Center youth.
Prerequisites: YOU MUST REVIEW THE WEBSITE AT www.berkshirefarm.org, COMPLETE THE APPLICATION AND SIGN OFF ON AGENCY POLICIES. Questions can be directed to Donelle Hauser at 518-461-2685 or dhauser@berkshirefarm.org.

ANSO 12 Children and the Courts
This is an interdisciplinary, experiential course taught by a Justice of the Juvenile Court. Students will have the opportunity to observe court proceedings, mainly in the juvenile
court, but also in the other trial court departments in Berkshire County. The course involves a weekly journal relevant to what the student has observed during the previous week,
a mock trial at the conclusion of the course and a final project of the students choosing. Students are also invited to a weekly dinner at the home of the instructor to discuss issues
relating to the course. It is the hope that students will take advantage of the wealth of experience and knowledge that the professionals who work within the juvenile justice system
possess and that through these interactions the students will gain an understanding of this part of the judicial branch.
Requirements: final project, mock trial participation and journal entry.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost: none.
Meeting time: students come to court with instructor or another attorney.

ANSO 25 Traditional Silk and Cotton Weaving in Thailand and Laos
The trip is designed for about 8 Williams Students to study the craft and cultural meanings of traditional silk and cotton weaving in Thailand and Laos, and to weave their own silk
fabric on traditional handlooms under expert supervision in Vientiane.
The Winter Study period and this course begins in Chiang Mai, Thailand on Monday, January 6. This will require that we depart from the US on January 2 in order to begin a one
week experience in sericulture, silk dyeing, weaving and its cultural importance in the lives of women with Prof Patricia Cheesman, Chiang Mai University. Prof Cheesman is the
author of several well-regarded books and papers on the traditional textiles of SE Asia, and, during the week of January 6 will conduct a hands-on workshop in the production and
dyeing of silk and a series of field trips in northern Thailand. There will be time in the evening to assess local silk textile production for the casual tourist in the active Chiang Mai
marketplace, as well as selected small shops dealing in antique examples.
Leaving Chiang Mai on or about January 12, we head north toward Chiang Khong, on the Mekong River. There, we will catch the river ferry downstream to Luang Prabang in
Laos on January 14 or 15, arriving two days later after an overnight stop in Pak Beng. En route to Chiang Khong, we will stop in Chiang Rai to visit a Williams alum who lives in
Thailand, and may be able to provide further access to local collections, especially of cotton weaving. In Luang Prabang, we will see the famous night market, and a sampling of
silk and cotton textiles produced for modern uses. We will leave Luang Prabang on, or about January 19 to visit two or three Lao villages on the Vietnam border to see traditional
weaving in situ. I am told that traditional textiles are still worn in these villages, where the pace of economic development has been very slow. Our guide will be Ms. Taykeo
Sayavongkhamdy, a Laotian woman in the business of making reproduction Lao silk/cotton textiles. Returning to Luang Prabang on January 22, we will fly south to Vientiane.
In Vientiane from January 22-29, students will have access to the looms in Ms. Taykeo’s atelier, and, under the supervision of some of her master weavers, can work on their own
weavings.
On January 30, the group will fly to Bangkok. Some may wish to stay in Bangkok for a few more days on their own account; others will return directly to the US. Classes begin
on February 5. The ticket arrangements will be made accordingly, with students responsible for any charges incurred after the official end of the Course.
Requirements: required reading and 8 packets of key articles will be assembled to carry with us, as well as single copies of 1-3 key books. Student weavings will be available for
an exhibition on campus on their return. Students will also be asked to write an up to 10-page paper as an aesthetic critique and structural and cultural description of an old or new
Southeast Asian textile (or a tribal group of textiles) they have seen on the trip. The paper will include illustrative digital shots of the textile(s), and, if possible, their surround, e.g.,
a village, a loom, etc. Since all needed references may not be available in the field, the papers will be due soon after our return to the US.
Prerequsites: none, but all applicants for this course will be interviewed by the leader.
Cost: roughly, about $3,500-$4,000 per student.

ART HISTORY
ARTH 10 Inventing Joan of Arc: The History of a Hero(ine) in Pictures and Film
Joan of Arc (known during her own lifetime most commonly as Jeanne “la Pucelle,” or Joan “the Maid”) was one of the most dynamic and yet enigmatic personalities of the
European Middle Ages. Born into a peasant family in the French border province of Lorraine in 1412, she gained control of an army, won brilliant military victories, crowned a
king, and was burnt at the stake as a heretic, all before her twentieth birthday. Triply marginalized by gender, age, and socio-economic status, she nonetheless managed to shake
the Church and State establishments to their very core. But who was Joan of Arc? Nationalist martyr? Pioneer feminist? Champion of the people? Instrument of God’s grace?
Victim of post-traumatic stress disorder? Over the centuries since her death, artists-and not just politicians and scholars-have attempted to answer this question, creating myriad
visions of la Pucelle under the influence of an ever-changing lens of contemporary tastes and concerns. Through readings and discussion, this course will survey the history of
representations of Joan of Arc in painting, prints, sculpture, and film, from the time of her death to the present.
Requirements: 10-page paper or comparable creative project.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Method of selection: according to interest level and GPA.

ARTH 24 Art History and Art Studio Practice in Siena, Italy (Same as ARTS 24)
This course is a unique, layered exploration of art, based on the intersection of past and present. The phenomenological study of past objects, and exploration of the physical site
and the cultural contexts and processes of their creation, will become the foundation, over the duration of the course, for the student’s own experience as a working artist today.
Living and studying in Siena Italy will provide students with the opportunity, impossible in Williamstown, to experience works from the past while immersing themselves in the
culture of the city—both past and present—in which they were created. They will then take these firsthand experiences into the studio. This exploration of art from a double
temporal perspective will allow students to ask questions about the past—not simply the past as a storehose of images, but the past as a dynamic site of the production of visual
culture that we can still experience, and challenge themselves to explore and understand how such a historical presence and consciousness might translate into their own present
day work.
In Siena we will view and study key historic art works, in and around Siena, as well as bring that experience to the studio, and create original artworks in the studio.
Evaluation will be based on one 5 page paper and original art work, each counting 50 percent.
Prerequisites: one art studio and one art history course, or permission of instructor.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Students will be accepted according, first, to prerequiste requirements and, secondly, to written student statements.

ART STUDIO
ARTS 10 The Art of Abstraction: Chinese Calligraphy (Same as CHIN 10 and JAPN 10)
Beginning in the fourth century, Chinese calligraphy has remained one of the highest art forms in China and in East Asia generally practiced by the literati, or highly erudite
scholars. Primarily a studio art course, this will also offer students an opportunity to acquire an understanding of the theoretical and aesthetic principles of Chinese calligraphy.
Studio practice allows students to apply theories to creating beautiful writing, or calligraphy (from Greek kallos “beauty” + graphe “writing”). Students will also have an opportunity to investigate contemporary artists whose works are either inspired or influenced by Chinese calligraphy, and those whose works are akin to Chinese calligraphy in their
abstraction.
Requirements: class attendance; weekly assignments; class discussion participation; and a final artistic project. An exhibition will be arranged to display students’ artworks at the
end of WSP. Missing 2 or more classes will result in dismissal from class.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost: $120.
Meeting time: mornings.

ARTS 11 Salvaging Words, Objects, and Environments
Everyday objects, whether freshly mass-produced plastic Dollar Store combs or rusty tin cans, are routinely utilized by artists as raw material for their artistic explorations. Often
this scavaging and reappropriation of objects yields artwork with powerful historical, social, and emotional narratives.
In this class we will scavenge for objects that already exist in the material and natural worlds. Students will collect, evaluate and arrange these materials to explore how this kind
of art-making can convey meaning. Students will be encouraged to think about how the arrangement and juxtaposition of objects can affect the viewer.
This course has a multidisciplinary approach that will introduce students to the practices of a variety of sculptors, architects, and performance artists who communicate in this
manner. From hair to rubber tires to surplus carpet tiles and taxidermied animals, artists like Sonya Clark, Chakaia Booker, Rural Studio, and Punchdrunk single out objects to
reframe how we see the world around us.
We will make a studio visit to a professional artist currently working in this style. There will also be field trips to regional salvage outlets to “pick” for materials. The class will
culminate in a public exhibition of individual and group projects.
Outside-of-class work will include viewing films, research, and studio time to complete projects.
Requirements: final project.
Prerequisites: appropriate for students with little or no studio art experience.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost: $100.
Meeting time: mornings; instructors will meet with students once a week, outside of class, to provide guidance and feedback on the development of the final project.

ARTS 12 Figure Drawing
In this course students will develop representational, technical, and expressive skills through studies in drawing from the life model. We will inform our practice in drawing
through the study of accomplished figure drawings from the history of western art. Creating your own studies “in the manner of” such drawings, you will learn to develop
methods suitable for varied approaches to the human figure. In addition to working directly from the model during class meetings, you will also be expected to develop drawings
outside of class times, including copies of drawings, anatomical studies, self portraiture, and working up figure sketches into more developed compositions. In addition to studio
work we will allow some time for brief slide lectures and for critique.
Evaluation will be based on the level of achievement in the drawings.

ARTS 13 How to Be a Medieval Stone Mason
Students will learn the rudiments of medieval stone carving from Marcel Müller, a German stone mason who has worked on some of Europe’s most important Gothic churches,
who will lead them step by step through the making of a Gothic rose window. They will design the window according to Gothic practice, prepare full-scale templates, and then
carve the entire window from stone. In the process they will learn something of the physical properties of stone, the use of stone-cutting tools, and the practice of stereotomy (the
art of projecting geometrical forms onto three-dimensional solids). Students should be willing to work in the studio a minimum of twenty hours a week. We will spend a day
visiting a stone quarry in Vermont and inspecting the building stones used on the Williams College campus.
Requirements: students will be evaluated just as a medieval stone apprentice would: by the care and quality of their workmanship and their effort in the studio.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Preference will be given to students who have taken ARTS 100 and/or courses in medieval art and architecture.

ARTS 26 Urban Design for Climate Change (Same as ENVI 26)
Ecological forces have triumphed over man-made efforts to keep our coastal cities dry and safe. New weather patterns will become the norm and it is time to approach urban
planning in a different spirit. New Orleans has not been idle in the seven years since Hurricane Katrina, and it is here where the new synthesis of environmental and urban
planning is being studied and tested. Here we will learn about and visit wetlands reclamation projects at the macro and micro levels, neighborhood floodways, sponge parks, and
housing sites that are using new zoning and building requirements to make houses less vulnerable to weather. Students will learn about the conflicts between private and public
interests, short and long term thinking, and environmental versus engineering solutions. We will learn how stewardship of the land and water upon which the city depends can
work in harmony with measures to protect the city and withstand the onslaughts of climate change. Students will build upon the knowledge they absorb from the service work,
lectures and tours in a final design project in Williamstown. Armed with their new knowledge, as well as lectures and readings on basic urban design strategies, students will
work in the Architecture Studio to design their own new neighborhood at the Spruces mobile home park. Working as a team, the class will develop an ecologically sustainable
neighborhood built to withstand weather onslaughts.
The class will spend the first two weeks in New Orleans and the third week back on campus. There will be a weekend trip to the Delta region as well as well as some service days
working on a Habitat for Humanity project.
Prerequisites: none; appropriate for architecture and planning students, and also a good opportunity for students who are not in either of these programs to learn about planning

JAPN 11 The Kamikaze in Japanese Film
They made their first appearance in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 in The Philippines. By 1945, Admiral William Halsey, the commander of the US 3rd Fleet declared
that the kamikaze was “the only weapon I fear in war.” Indeed, no figure in the annals of military history, let alone the Pacific War, has aroused such a mixture of dread, revulsion
and sometimes, even pity, than the kamikaze. Often just teenagers, the kamikaze, “winds of god,” were pilots sent off on one way missions with just enough fuel to reach their
intended target. As the Pacific War moved toward its inevitable end, few survived, virtually none returned. And during those final days of the war, as that end hastened, the fatal
missions escalated, the losses mounted as the kamikaze embarked on a mission to sink as many US warships as possible. But the mission was futile from the start. The futility of
the kamikaze sacrifices only deepened their tragic demise: kamikaze naval assaults would have no effect on the outcome of the war.
Service in the elite Tokkotai Special Attack Squadron was supposed to be completely voluntary. Was it really? Who were the kamikaze, these comrade-in-arms, and what were
their origins? Why are they still so honored in Japanese culture? And what did they think or feel on that last day, that last flight to the Fates? This course will be attentive to
questions such as these in the context of films of the kamikaze, who sought glorious death in certain defeat, in this, their chosen destiny of self-sacrifice. It will look at the purity of
intention they embraced, the devout fealty that inspired them, and the fatalistic, if not flawed decision they deployed in the name of duty to deliver a coup de grace for an utterly
lost cause.

ASTRONOMY/ASTROPHYSICS
ASTR 25 Astronomy in the Twenty-First Century: California and Washington (Same as ASPH 25)
In the late 19th-century, the center of astronomy moved from the east (where Alvan Clark, who had made his first telescope for Williams College in 1851 ultimately made what is
still the largest refracting telescope in the world, in Wisconsin in the 1890s) to California, where first the 100” and then the 200” telescopes on Mt. Wilson and Palomar Mountain,
respectively, were the largest in the world from 1917 through 1995. The current largest generation of telescopes, about 400 inches across in Hawaii (built by Caltech and the
University of California system) and Spain, are being superseded by 30-meter (1200-inch) telescopes, the Thirty Meter Telescope (www.tmt.org) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (gmto.org), both based in California, as well as by the 39-meter European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT; www.eelt.org). We will visit the headquarters of the TMT
and of the GMT in Pasadena, California, to learn about the optical, laser, mechanical, and other aspects of the planning, as well as NASA’s ExoPlanet Science Center at Caltech.
We will also visit the latest observational facilities at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, including the new interferometric array, and at the Palomar Observatory. Our two weeks of
travel will follow participation in the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society near Washington, DC, where these and other contemporary observational projects,
such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, will be discussed. Schedule: January 5-10 in and near Washington, DC; January 10-20 in and near Pasadena, CA. We will finish
WSP with discussion and consideration in Williamstown of what the current status of observational astronomy is.

BIOLOGY
BIOL 10 Observational Drawing From The Natural World (Same as ARTS 14)
This is a drawing course for students interested in developing their skills in observing and drawing from nature. Much of the class work will deal with drawing directly from plant
forms and specimens from the animal world and to this end we will be using an interesting collection of stuffed mounts and skeletons that belong to the Williams Biology
department. We will also spend time in the Morley greenhouse. Beyond the subject matter at hand, assignments will also address and analyze the more formal aspects of drawing
and two-dimensional design with outside assignments including independent visits to the Clark, the WCMA study collection and the Chapin Library of Rare Books.
Evaluation will be based on both the completion of in-class work and outside drawing assignments, with a focus on the depiction of content, level of effort, and development of
the work. Evidence of technical and skill development as well as attendance and participation will also be taken into consideration. There will be a considerable amount of
scheduled time outside of regular class meetings for additional assignments. Exhibition and review of work at the final class meeting is required.

CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as SPEC 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter
Study Project is to design a series of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4, students spend the first two and a half
weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students involved) followed by choosing and
designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 25, 26) we bring elementary school kids
with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it’s like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great
fun to work with because they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their parents a chance to actually do some fun
hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won’t be intimidating. It is a
rewarding experience for all involved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids,
parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites; you need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm.

CHEM 14 Beyond Hooking Up: Creating Meaningful Relationships (Same as PSYC 14 and SPEC 14)
Looking back on past loves and crushes, have you ever wondered “What on earth was I thinking?!” or “Why do I keep picking the wrong guys/girls for me?” While intense
sexual attraction or urges may first call the shots, people who take the time to carefully choose and build caring, mutual relationships tend to be happier, healthier and more
successful in their lives than those who don’t. So how do we get there from here and make sense of all this? Well, no matter where you are on the dating spectrum, this self-exploration and relationship-skill-building course is for you if you are ready to learn how to follow your heart AND your mind to co-create a fulfilling relationship within the vortex of
the “hook up” culture. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, How to Avoid Falling In Love with A Jerk, and Keeping the Love You Find curricula will guide this introspective,
interactive relationship mastery course through meaningful discussions and exercises that explore the common issues, dirty fighting tactics, subconscious directives and emotional allergies that often sabotage relationships. Experiential exercises, personal experiences and journaling will also give you the opportunity to practice effective communication
and conflict resolution skills that honor the constructive use of differences and promote intimacy.
Email your statement of interest to ssmith@williams.edu if you are curious about relationships, ready and willing to BE the change, delve into personal growth and take your
relationships to the next level.

CLASSICS
CLAS 10 Rewrites of Homer (Same COMP 10)
In Jorge Luis Borges’s essay “Some Versions of Homer,” he (or rather Suzanne Jill Levine, who translated the article into English) posits that “No problem is more essential to
literature and its small mysteries than translation.” This class will read essays on the theory of translation as we consider versions of Homer, from the translations of Chapman and
Hall, Cowper and Pope, Lattimore, Fitzgerald, and Fagles, to the Coen brothers’ film, Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Focusing on specific passages from the Iliad and Odyssey,
we will examine the choices that are made and shifts that occur when Homer is rendered into another language as well as other media.
Requirements: readings assigned for class, class attendance and final 10-page project.
Prerequisites: none.

CLAS 11 Alexander the Great (Same as HIST 11)
In this course we will be exploring the many different Alexanders that have existed over the centuries, and we will try to gain insight into the hold he has had on our imaginations
for over two millennia. In different places and ages he has been the ideal warrior-king; the pious leader whose exploits serve God; the brilliant but vulnerable boy-king corrupted
by sudden wealth and power; the philosopher-king who debated the sages of India or lived a life of Stoic virtues; the isolated, out-of-touch mad leader; the liberator of the
oppressed; the lonely romantic seeker; the tyrannical despot. Ancient accounts of his life evolved into mythologies for the new world he had created with his conquests. These
tales circulated throughout Greece, North Africa, the Near East and India, and later by way of Rome throughout the western world, growing into separate and distinct traditions as
each culture made Alexander its own.
Readings include the ancient accounts of Alexander that are our primary sources for his life; selections from the Bible and Qur’an, from the medieval English Alexander tradition, and from the medieval Ethiopic, Armenian and Persian romances of Alexander; later works such as Racine’s Alexandre le Grande and Kipling’s The Man Who Would Be
King; and selected works of modern scholarship, some of which have been surprisingly argumentative and impassioned. We will also examine visual representations of Alexander in ancient sculpture and coinage, Indian and Persian manuscripts, and European paintings of the Renaissance. We will encounter the musical Alexander in works from
Handel to Iron Maiden, and view films including Oliver Stone’s idiosyncratic Alexander.
Requirements: two 2-page analyses of selected course materials, an oral presentation, and a final 5- to 7-page paper, in addition to preparation for and participation in class
meetings.
No prerequisites other than a serious interest in Alexander and his multiform legacy.
Enrollment limit: 15.
If the course is oversubscribed, preference will be given to majors in Classics, Comparative Literature, History, and Art History.
Cost: $50.
Meeting time: afternoons.
CHRISTENSEN
CLAS 12 Greek Myth and the Modern Cinema
This course will examine the mythic narratives that formed the basis of ancient Greek religion and culture, especially those concerning cosmological and human origins, epic
heroes and trickster figures—for example, Hesiod’s Theogony, Homer’s Odyssey, and the Homeric Hymn to Hermes. We will explore these narratives by using a variety of
theoretical approaches, including psychoanalytic and structural analysis, and by comparing them to other ancient texts like The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Book of Genesis. In
tandem with this project, we will view and discuss several Hollywood films, such as Star Wars: Episode IV and The Dark Knight, in order gain to insight into the important
similarities and differences between Greek myths and myths of contemporary American society.
Requirements: 10-page paper or final project.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 10 The Grand Hotel in Modern Fiction and Film
In this course, we will visit actual hotel spaces in our area, read contemporary and early twentieth-century hotel fiction, and discuss a broad range of hotel films, from drama to
comedy. The grand hotel with its dual promise of luxury and estrangement was considered a theatre of social transformation in the age of travel. We will read novels, short stories,
and discuss films that feature the hotel as a space that would either uphold class distinction or give rise to class conflict, allow for sexual taboo breaking, or stage gendered identity
performance. Authors and filmmakers in this early period will include Edith Wharton, Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Vicki Baum, and F.W. Murnau. We will consider short
theoretical readings by Thorstein Veblen, Georg Simmel, Siegfried Kracauer on conspicuous consumption, modernity, and metropolitan spaces. In the present, hotel dramas
focus on issues of ethnic violence (Hotel Rwanda), the invisible immigrant worker (Dirty Pretty Things), cultural alienation (Lost in Translation), and the female body at work (A
Single Girl). Comedies explore the fantasy of a dramatic social climb through identity confusion in a hotel setting (Maid in Manhattan); satires highlight the confidence man who
profits from social pretensions (from Thomas Mann’s trickster and sexual adventurer Felix Krull, to the hilarious high-school dropout/runaway posing as the scion of a wealthy
executive in Thomas Brussig’s Wie es leuchtet). Fantasy writing creates virtual hotel spaces (Robert Coover’s The Grand Hotels of Joseph Cornell). Theoretical readings focus
on private versus public spaces, social distinction, warped space, and shopping for brands by Pierre Bourdieu, Erving Goffmann, Tony Vidler and Sharon Zukin. We will also
study characteristics of real-life upscale area hotels like Blantyre, The Porches through site visits.
Requirements: active class participation, one oral presentation on an aspect of hotel culture, and one 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Preference given to Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, and English majors.
Cost: $45 for books and xerox package.

DRUXES
COMP 11 Contemporary Scandinavian Film
For a long time Scandinavian cinema was, for filmgoers outside Denmark, Sweden and Norway, almost synonymous with the work of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman
(1918-2007). But in the last two decades a new and heterogeneous Scandinavian cinema has been blooming: love stories, comedies, and thrillers abound—along with psycho-

305

logical studies that remain solidly in the Bergmanian tradition. After a brief encounter with two of Bergman’s masterpieces (the drama Persona, and the autobiographical Fanny
and Alexander), this class will cover some of the most interesting examples of recent Scandinavian cinema from a wide range of genres, and consider the ways these films reflect
on Scandinavian society. We’ll begin with Danish director Lars von Trier, whose entire oeuvre may be read as a prolonged questioning of Scandinavian rationalism and self-understanding. (We will discuss his philosophical comedy The Idiots and the apocalyptic Melancolia). We will also watch one of the great successes in recent Danish cinema, Lone
Scherfig’s drama An Education, as an example of psychological portraiture. From Sweden we will discuss Ruben Östlund’s much debated Play, Tomas Alfredsson’s vampire/
love story Let the Right One In, and Roy Andersson’s dreamlike You, the Living. Contemporary Norwegian film will be represented by The Bothersome Man (Jens Lien), which
discusses Scandinavian society from an unexpected angle, and the fantasy versus reality/documentary film Troll Hunter (André Øvredal). Together, these films convey a rich but
not unproblematic image of life in contemporary Scandinavia.
Requirements: 10-page final paper or creative project.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 25.

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSCI 10 Designing and Building a Desktop Computer
This course introduces the student to computer components and the methods used to design and construct a fully working desktop system. Students will assemble a computer
from existing spare parts to end up with a system suitable for a specific purpose: as a campus email and print station, for remote controlled digital signage, as a network backup
server, or as a general purpose computer that can be donated off campus. We will conduct speed tests using different components to determine what impact they have on overall
performance. Each student will install an operating system, choosing from free Linux distributions or licensed Windows OSs, download appropriate drivers, diagnostic software,
security programs and free productivity suites. We’ll look at Virtual Machines and discuss remote control software as additional tools to add functionality to a computer. Looking
forward we will examine emerging computer technology, trends and intriguing advancements like quantum computers.
The class will meet three times a week in a lab equipped with the hardware, spare parts and tools for assembly. Research and written assignments outside of class will be due

CSCI 14 Bots, Malware, and The Underground Economy
It is estimated that between 10 and 20% of all broadband connected systems in the US are infected with some form of bot or malware. With the rapid growth of android based
infections, this problem is rapidly migrating from Windows PCs onto phones, tablets, and other machines. Malware based attacks have stolen millions, perhaps billions of dollars
over the last few years, through credit/bank fraud and identity theft. Malware based DDOS have knocked major corporations, and even some governments, offline. This, in turn,
has caught the attention of governments around the world, with most passing some new form of cybersecurity legislation as a result.
This course will sit at the intersection of software, cybersecurity policy, and the underground economy. Students will learn about bots (what they do, why they’re used, and how
they work), the underground economy (from the dropper that infects the machine to the herder who runs the infection to mules that clean out the bank accounts), and how
governments have reacted with modern cybersecurity legislation. Students will examine past and current bots and malware, they will review past criminal cases (and possibly
some current ones, depending), and they will review proposed and current US and foreign cybersecurity legislation.
Most reading material for this class will be made up of online articles, papers, and blog posts...although some printed books may be used. The class format will consist of reading
and research assignments, with individual (or pairs of) students being assigned specific areas to present to the class at the next meeting. These presentations will then lead to class
discussion, and additional lecture from the professor if required. If possible, there will be a lab exercise to analyze live malware.
Final evaluation will cover these classroom presentations, as well as the creation of a final project. The exact form of the final project will be left to the student, subject to the
approval of the professor.
Requirements: classroom participation combined with a final project or paper.
Prerequisites: none; although basic computer knowledge will be required.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Preference will be given to Computer Science majors.

DANCE
DANC 10 The MELT Method—The Art of Self Care and Hydrating Your Connective Tissue
The MELT Method is a self treatment technique to reduce and eliminate pain. The self care technique uses small rubber balls and a foam roller to effectively soften and hydrate
your connective tissue or fascia. Recent research has proven that our fascia operates as it’s own unique system within the body. Learn how to undo the negative effects that
repetition has on our bodies. This anti-aging technique will reduce chronic pain, increase your energy level and keep you balanced an hydrated. It recalibrates your body’s innate
sense to want to be balanced. Students will learn the scientific theory of the body’s fascia and how keeping it hydrated is essential for a pain free life. They will learn each of the
techniques and how to properly perform them. Students will be requires to practice and keep a daily log. Readings will include articles on connective tissue and the MELT
Method book. Students will be required to attend a weekly MELT class followed by discussion. The final project will be a summary of their daily log.

ECON 14 Economics of Housing and Community Portrayed in Film
The idea that a successful life must include home ownership in a decent neighborhood has been severely challenged in the recent recession. Where did this idea come from in the
first place? In this class we will examine one important source: the presentation of home ownership and community in film. We will view both narrative and documentary films
that present ideal and dystopic visions of housing, home-ownership and community. Most of the films are set in the American context but some deal with other countries and
cultures. These stories, imagined and real, will provide the context for a wider discussion of the economic linkages between houses and communities as well as the implications
for individual well-being and economic stability.

This course involves internship in a developing or transition economy—and an academic analysis of the development issues raised by the internship. Students work full-time
typically for a non-governmental organization (NGO) active in grassroots development work (or less commonly, with a government office or a research institute). Examples
include health, education, microfinance or environmental NGOs. The instructors will work with each student to help arrange a placement and to help secure funding; such
arrangements must be made well in advance of Winter Study. An informational meeting will take place early in the fall for planning purposes. Students will be expected to make
their own contact with internship providers. Each student’s internship provider shall send a confirmation letter to the instructor verifying the placement and describing the nature
of the work to be performed by the intern. Students will read a few short articles distributed at the end of fall term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly contact with
the instructors, and write a final paper on development issues raised by their specific internship. A group meeting of all students will occur after Winter Study to reflect on
individual experiences. Students will also be encouraged to attend development talks at the Center for Development Economics throughout the academic year.
Requirements: 90 hours of fieldwork; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper or equivalent; participation in final meeting.

ECON 22 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) (Same as POEC 22)
This course examines tax policy towards low-income families in the United States, and has the following three objectives: 1) For students to understand the shift of redistributive
policy in the United States from income support through the transfer system (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) towards
support of working individuals through the tax system (primarily the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)); 2) For students to understand the challenges that low income individuals have “making ends meet” and to understand the role that the EITC has played in increasing the standard of living of the working poor; and 3) To enable students to understand
the tax code well enough to prepare simple income tax returns, including those for filers claiming the EITC. Students will be trained by the IRS to prepare income tax returns for
low-income individuals and families. At the end of the term, students will use their newly acquired expertise to help individuals and families in Berkshire County prepare and file
their returns. Class meetings will involve a mixture of discussion of assigned readings, and exercises that help develop tax preparation skills and understanding of poverty.
Assignments outside of class include: a variety of short readings on tax policy, the challenges of living in poverty in the U.S., and public policies that address these challenges;
completion of an online course in IRS VITA training; and staffing approximately six hours of tax preparation assistance during the final week of winter term. The volunteer tax
preparation sessions take place in North Adams and are usually Wednesday and Thursday evenings during the final week of Winter Study, and then Thursday evenings and
Saturday mornings after that.
Evaluation is based on the results of the IRS certification test, students’ work as tax preparers, and a ten-page analytical and reflective essay.

ENGL 12 Noir/Neo-noir
Film noir is a French term for American moviemaking. It refers to a kind of plot (violent and complicated), a kind of woman (beautiful but dangerous), and a kind of camerawork
(atmospheric and anxiety-provoking). By most accounts noir gets its start in the forties, runs out in the fifties and then is revived in a secondary form—neo-noir—by later
filmmakers. In this course we will watch movies from noir’s so-called classic period —The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, Kiss Me Deadly—as well as
neo-noirs including, Chinatown, Basic Instinct, Pulp Fiction, and Fargo. Students will also be required to attend three film screenings per week, to keep a viewing journal, and to
write a final essay. In addition to critical discussions of noir, students will read hard-boiled detective fiction from the pulp magazine Black Mask.
Requirements: final paper, class presentation, journal.
Prerequisites: none.

ENGL 13 Uncreative Writing
It’s clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and digital replication. How does writing respond
to this new environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation, replication, plagiarism, piracy, sampling, plundering, as compositional methods. Along the way, we’ll trace the rich history of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning the arts, with a particular emphasis on how they
employ language. We’ll see how the modernist notions of chance, procedure, repetition, and the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional
notions of time, place, and identity, all as expressed linguistically. The preceding description, it should be said, is a plagiarism, appropriated from Kenneth Goldsmith’s uncannily
similar “Uncreative Writing” course at the University of Pennsylvania. This Winter Study course will take up modes of inexpressive writing that sometimes travel under the
name of “Conceptual Writing” (a term derived by analogy from the conceptual art movements of the ’60s & ’70s) or “Uncreative Writing. We will run primarily as a writing
workshop, with an emphasis on uncreativity and procedure-based writing assignments, both in and outside of class. We will also engage in a critical investigation of the history
and theoretical bases of appropriation and chance-based modes of writing. Our main focus will be on writing and language-based works, but our stumbles will also take us into

309

the visual arts, including conceptual art, as well as contemporary music. At least one field trip will be part of this course, as well as a visit to MassMoCA in North Adams. No
creative writing experience necessary. Reading/viewing/listening will include works by Kenneth Goldsmith, Christian Bök, Vanessa Place, Marcel Duchamp, John Baldessari,
John Cage, Sol Lewitt, Christian Marclay, Girl Talk, and others.

ENGL 16 Embodying the Poetry of Gertrude Stein (Same as DANC 16)
As a poet and personality, the American expatriate Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) has remained an attractive irritant. Her poems are playful yet relentless, literal yet obtuse, fluid yet
disjointed. In this course, we will explore the kinesthetic relationship between movement and language, entering into the environment of Stein’s work through physicality. We
will identify many of the simultaneous, layered features of the writing by means of hand-copying, reading aloud, body tapping, moving slowly, rotating as an ensemble, drawing
color pattern posters, interpreting gibberish, walking in formation, analyzing linguistic habit, eavesdropping, scoring musically, memorizing short lines of text, and presenting a
showing of Stein’s poetry embodied.
Stein chides in a 1934 interview, “Look here. Being intelligible is not what it seems. You mean by understanding that you can talk about it in the way that you have a habit of
talking, putting it in other words. But I mean by understanding enjoyment. If you enjoy it, you understand it.” (brainpickings.org)
We will work from the following texts:
Composition as Explanation, Portraits and Repetition, Poetry and Grammar, Tender Buttons, George Hugnet, If I Told Him, Cezanne, Matisse, The Life and Death of Juan Gris,
Four Dishonest Ones, A Valentine to Sherwood Anderson, Van or Twenty Years After, Lipschitz, As A Wife Has A Cow: A Love Story, Four Saints in Three Acts, and The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.
Requirements: class participation, homework assignments, showing.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 12.
A strong, affectionate curiosity about language and the arts is essential. Comfort with physical expression and theater is useful. Students may write a letter explaining why they
are interested in this course and how it might inform their other studies.

ENGL 17 The Winter Naturalist’s Journal (Same as ENVI 17)
(See under ENVI 17 for full description.)

ENGL 18 Stories and Pictures (Same as ARTS 18)
What would you do if Vladimir Nabokov suddenly appeared and said: “Read this thing I wrote, and then make a twenty second stop-motion animation that captures what it feels
like to long for a country that doesn’t exist anymore. You have a week.”? What if Julio Cortazar demanded you made a drawing which offered a realistic solution to a magical
problem? You don’t even want to know what Kurt Vonnegut would want from you.
“Stories and Pictures” can help you prepare for these kinds of situations. In this class, we will read a short story every week, and produce a visual response to it. We will talk about
the different ways in which the written word can provide fuel for image-making, and figure out how to make good art fast. In our meetings we will discuss the stories we’ve read,
see how other visual artists use narrative to inform their work and try out various art-making techniques such as drawing, painting, digital photography and video. We will meet 3
times weekly for 2-hour sessions, and students should plan to invest at minimum an equal amount of time on their projects outside of class.
Requirements: four artworks and one class presentation, as well as ongoing participation in class discussion.
No prerequisites.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
ENVI 10 Campus Sustainability: Culture Shift and Personal Behavior Change
The issue of how to change an institution like Williams to be more environmentally sustainable is complicated and multi-faceted. Much of the progress that Williams has made
thus far in reducing our environmental impact has been through largely invisible technical changes: updates of mechanical and lighting systems, increases in the efficiency of our
central heating plant, and insulating and weatherizing buildings. Changing individual behavior and campus culture towards sustainability has proven to be a longer and more
challenging road. This course invites students to participate in that process.
The first part of the course will focus on gaining an understanding of sustainability issues and possibilities for change using Williams College as a case study. Students will lead
discussions with guidance from the instructor on a range of sustainability topics, including consumption, waste, energy use, water, food, and climate change. Throughout the
readings and discussions, there will be consideration of a variety of practical approaches to behavior change and culture shift. A substantial proportion of the class will be devoted
to an on-campus project of the students’ choosing that is designed to change the Williams campus, community or culture to be more sustainable.
Readings will include Fostering Sustainable Behavior: An Introduction to Community Based Social Marketing by Doug McKenzie-Mohr, excerpts from The Psychology of
Environmental Problems by Deborah DuNann Winter and Susan M. Koger in addition to articles and excerpts from other books. Students will have readings prior to every class.
Responsibility and preparation for leading discussion will rotate among students.
Requirements: 3-page final project proposal and rationale, final project, and final project reflection.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Preference will be given to first year students and sophomores.

ENVI 11 The Winter Woods
This course will focus on the winter season and its effect in molding the wild landscapes of New England. We will take a hands-on approach toward investigating how plants and
animals are adapted to enduring winter conditions of our region. We will make frequent field trips to Hopkins Forest and other regional sites to explore phenomena ranging from
micro-climate and snow pack; to physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations of flora and fauna; to winter plant identification, wildlife observation and tracking; to
personal acclimation to the cold. We will also consider the effects of climate change and human impacts upon the winter landscape. Students will be expected to spend some time
out of class individually making and recording observations. Field activities will be bolstered by readings and class discussions. Students should be prepared to spend many hours
out in the elements and be able to hike several miles through snow. Some field trips may necessitate that students be away from campus beyond normal class hours.
Requirements: 10-page paper or equivalent work.

ENVI 14 Rethinking School: Connecting Education, Environment and Community
This course will examine the idea of using the environment and community as a central focus for designing the public school system to deliver an education that parents value and
that students want. The United States’ public school system has the potential to deliver engaging and stimulating instruction that students find relevant and fun. We will explore
using the environment as a learning tool, using technology that blends games with instruction and using communities to support students’ education that will prepare students for
higher education or a vocation, with the knowledge to protect and use wisely the world’s natural resources and ecosystem processes.
We will examine the prominence of advertising and media as a superbly well-financed education system that achieves its mission of training consumers, but often in ways that
can be detrimental to the health of the individual and of earth’s processes. We will juxtapose that media and advertising system with the poorly financed public school system and
study methods that the public schools can use to provide a stimulating education that focuses on educating the whole person equipped to make decisions that are beneficial to
their health, wellbeing and living a productive life, and being expert in the knowledge that the earth’s systems that must remain healthy and productive as well.
We will examine theories of learning using resources of the most advanced thinkers. We’ll explore teaching models ranging from strict rote memorization to the experiential less
structured formats found in some school systems.
A portion of the course will be hands-on and computer-based. We will learn about the upside down classroom, and the student centered learning while the teacher acts as a coach
rather than a content delivery manager. We’ll explore California’s Education and the Environment Initiative and progress other states are making in the efforts to raise environmental literacy among an entire population.
We’ll explore education theories including studies that show better student engagement when topics are taught through an environmental lens. We’ll discuss theories about how
learning happens and how it affects behavior change, looking especially at the Transcendent Function. And we’ll discuss the efficacy of using the education system to foster
behavior change.
Evaluation will be based on a 4- to 6-page essay and a PowerPoint presentation to the class on a topic of the student’s choosing and approved by the instructor. Attendance and
participation will also be taken into account.

ENVI 16 Shaping an Eco-Activist’s LifeAddressing
What spurs an individual to become an environmental activist? What can the myriad of personal trajectories of those moved to address a pressing environmental concern teach us
about how to achieve meaningful change?
This course will delve into the personal narratives of a broad range of eco-activists (US based and international), some still active today. We will be examining campaigns on
issues as varied as fracking, pesticide use, species protection, and climate change and will encounter proponents of diverse tactics including non-violent protest, public awareness
raising, litigation, and “monkey-wrenching.” These life stories will be explored trough activists’ own writings, films, and in some cases in person interactions with the class.

GEOS 12 Landscape Photography (Sames as ENVI 12)
This class will broaden students’ appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and teach the skills of making a successful photograph. Williamstown, situated in a
valley between the Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires
both professional and amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to learn principles of universal application.
Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph. They will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of digital photography, which will be reviewed at
biweekly class meetings. In addition to photographing and critiquing images, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Institute and WCMA to see original work and
examine and discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the history of landscape photography will be provided with an emphasis on American workers such as
Carlton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge, Alfred Stieglitz, Eliot Porter and Ansel Adams. We will also demonstrate examples of different cameras such as a large format. Students
will produce a body of successful photographs that will be projected at the Winter Study presentation day and on display at http://drm.williams.edu/projects/.
Students will submit short written explanations with each of their photographic assignments.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student’s photography, and their presentation.
Prerequisites: students will need a digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR) or a new generation electronic viewfinder (DSL) camera such as those by Sony or Olympus. See

GEOS 15 Geology of the National Parks (Same as ENVI 15)
A vicarious trip through a variety of national parks and monuments in the U.S. and Canada, with emphasis on the geological basis for their spectacular scenery. Areas to be
studied will be selected in order to portray a wide range of geologic processes (volcanism, desert erosion, mountain-building, glaciation, etc.). The class will meet most mornings
during the first two weeks for highly illustrated lectures and discussions, supplemented by the interpretation of topographic and geologic maps and by out-of-class study of rock
samples. Readings will be from a paperback text (PARKS AND PLATES) as well as short publications by the U.S. Geological Survey and various natural history associations.
The second part of the month will involve independent study and the preparation of an oral presentation about the geology of a park or monument of the student’s choice. The
student oral reports during the final week will be comprehensive and well illustrated, using PowerPoint, maps, samples and other reference materials. A detailed outline and
bibliography will be distributed by the presenter at the time of the report.
Requirements: based on attendance, participation, and the quality of the oral report.

HISTORY
HIST 10 The South in Black and White (Same as AFR 10)
The history of the American South is a racial one, where blacks and whites lived their lives intertwined and disconnected. Peculiar intimacies produced odd affections, deep
animosity, and profound fears. This course uses documentary materials, including autobiographies and memoirs; oral histories and narratives; essays and novels; and film and
music to consider the racial change that took place in the South in the 20th Century.

HIST 12 Soccer and Fever Pitch in the 21st Century
This course will use Nick Hornby’s 1992 book Fever Pitch as the basis for examinations of the historical and cultural meanings of soccer fandom in specific national and
transnational contexts. This course will examine both the construction of “regular” vs. “rabid” soccer fans and the lived experience of those branded as hooligans. We will
analyze both more recent accounts and film depictions to address questions that include: How and why does someone identify with a particular club or national side? What (and
how) do soccer/football/futebol/fútbol/calcio teams mean to their supporters? Are racism and violence inevitable outgrowths of passionate team support or just objectionable but
commonplace ones?
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.

KITTLESON
HIST 13 The Horse Wrote History (Same as AMST 13)
“A dog may be man’s best friend,” a well-worn anonymous quote goes, “but the horse wrote history.” In the last hundred years, it was the arrival of the “horseless carriage” in the
1910s that made many commentators worry that actual horses might exit the historical stage: what purpose would they serve with the arrival of much faster automobiles and
trucks? While the population of domestic horses did diminish, nonetheless, current estimates of domestic horses in the United States range between 7 and 9 million horses, and all
forms of equine recreation, and of course horse racing, remain immensely popular in this country. We clearly still need horses, but why? What has changed historically about
horses’ place in American culture? What do horses say about the changing patterns of American life and about our understandings of ourselves as individuals? And how have the
meanings that Americans have assigned to horses differed from those of other cultures and societies?
This course is for the non-rider and rider alike; we will use wide-ranging materials to explore these questions—academic texts, memoirs, conversations with equine professionals, films, and at least one field trip.
Evaluation will be based on short, informal writing responses to the assigned material and a final, interdisciplinary project.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost: $50-75.
Meeting time: mornings, 6 hours of class-time a week, plus a couple hours of additional activity a week, such as film viewing, in addition to reading.
MERRILL
HIST 14 The Name of the Rose
Heresy, labyrinths, libraries, sex, death and laughter: All are central to The Name of the Rose, a murder mystery, historical satire, medievalist fantasy, philosophical meditation,
and homage to Arthur Conan Doyle penned by the Italian medievalist Umberto Eco in 1980. The setting is an unnamed Italian monastery in 1327; the protagonist is Brother
William of Baskerville, a Franciscan friar and detective in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes. He and his novice Adso happen to arrive just hours after a mysterious death has put
the entire monastery on edge. William agrees to investigate, but more murders follow, one each over the next seven days—all of them (as William and Adso discover) according
to a strange and disturbing apocalyptic pattern. Eco’s intricate and textured novel has been widely acclaimed not only as a significant work of literature, but also as an unusually
insightful and sophisticated work of historical fiction; few novels enjoy as much cred among the medievalist community. In this course we will experience Eco’s novel as
entertaining detective fiction, as a work of literature, and as a port of entry into the later medieval world. In addition to Eco’s novel, we will consider some of its literary influences
(including Doyle and Jorge Luis Borges), as well as several relevant primary sources for the medieval world.
Evaluation will depend upon attendance, class participation, and a series of short reading responses.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 30.
Preference for prior coursework in medieval history.
Cost: $30.
Meeting time: afternoons.

HIST 15 Education Reform: Is it Innovation or Destruction? (Same as PSCI 15)
Some view education reform as a noble cause, others see it as cover for insidious motives such as privatization and profiteering. This course examines current debates in U.S.
K-12 education, such as charter schools, teacher preparation and evaluation, and national standards, through the lens of reformers and their critics. Topics will explore the historical context and politics of national, state and local control over public education, and the role of parents in reforming their children’s schools.
Students will meet one day each week from 10 a.m. to 3:50 p.m. to discuss and debate these topics, visit schools and education agencies, and meet with experts in the field.
Student teams will be assigned a topic each week to research and prepare to debate in class. In addition, students will be expected to read selected texts and continue discussions
online by posting short essays and critically responding to their peers.
Evaluation will be based on 1) weekly two-page essays plus critical responses to peer essays, and 2) preparation for and performance in debates.

HIST 16 From Pocahontas to Crazy Horse: Realities and Representations of Iconic Native Americans
In this course, we will explore the lives and times of four iconic Native Americans—as well as how their stories are constantly interpreted and reinterpreted—as a way of
understanding more about both the history of Native North America and the national myths of the United States. Most of these figures are familiar from textbook and legend:
Pocahontas, the original “Indian Princess”; Squanto, who famously taught the Pilgrims how to cultivate maize; Sacagawea, the quintessential guide, interpreter, and cultural
go-between of the Lewis and Clark expedition; and Crazy Horse, a Lakota warrior and leader who participated in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and is often credited with
Native success at Custer’s Last Stand. By considering how these individuals’ stories have been told through a variety of media such as films, websites, historic sites, sculpture,
and more, we will explore the symbolic uses of these individuals in American culture. We will also delve into the realities behind the symbols to contrast the actual experiences of
diverse Native peoples with the stereotypes that continue to evolve into the present day. Requirements: attendance, class preparation, final project analyzing local representation
of Native peoples/pasts/cultures.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Preference: History majors.

HIST 17 Eyewitness to the Civil Rights Movement: Mississippi 1964-’65
During sixteen months in 1964-’65, I worked as a civil rights organizer in rural Mississippi with the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). I witnessed and aided
in the heroic effort by black citizens to dismantle the pervasive structure of Jim Crow that had oppressed them for generations. I worked with relatively uneducated people who
had the stature of giants. The society I encountered was an apartheid America—a vicious police state reinforced by government and vigilante violence—beyond the understanding of most Americans and certainly beyond the imagination of young people today. The course will explore this transformative moment in recent American history, largely thru
discussion. Topics will include nonviolence, the role of the black church, black nationalism, Malcolm X and Black Power, the role of women, the role of whites, the third party
politics of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the actions of the federal government during the civil rights era. The course will examine how these events and issues
have played out over the ensuing decades, up to and including the election of Barack Obama. Documentary films as well as the music of the period will be utilized. Three books
covering the period will be assigned. Other veterans of the civil rights movement will visit the class to tell their stories. It is the intent of the instructor to convey the immediacy
that only first person experience can invoke.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a final project in any media approved by the instructor.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 20.

INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
INST 25 Art of Experience in Egypt (Same as ARTS 25)
This travel course begins in Williamstown where students begin to consider historical and cultural frameworks along with guidelines for travel in the Middle-EasVNorth Africa.
We read and discuss The Imaginary Orient by Linda Nochlin and The Yacoubian Building by Alaa AI Aswany, as well as writings on current events, ancient Egyptian art, and
other relevant texts. Students are introduced to techniques of watercolor painting prior to departure during a fall semester workshop and during the first days of Winter Study on
campus. In terms of art production while in Egypt: students are expected to keep an extensive sketchbook that visually documents each day’s encounters, as well as attend studio
workshops and critique sessions, and complete drawing and watercolor assignments. We spend the first 5 days in Cairo where students explore and visually document artist
studios, museums, and other cultural sites. Overnight train to takes us to Luxor where we spend 8 days working with art students from the Luxor College of Fine Art: students will
draw at cultural sites like Hassan Fathy’s New Gourna Village and Karnak Temple, in the marketplace, and on the Luxor College campus. We then spend four days in the Upper
Egyptian city of Aswan exploring the Nile at its most spectacular and encountering the Sudanese-influenced Nubian culture. In Aswan we focus on drawing the landscape and
Nubian villages, before heading back to Cairo where we visit the Giza Pyramids and participate in a final group critique.
Requirements: completed sketchbooks and art assignments including a final project, a short paper about one of the Egyptian artists encountered, and a supportive demeanor for
positive group dynamics.
Prerequisites: none, but some drawing experience highly recommended. Not open to first-year students.

JEWISH STUDIES
JWST 10 Russian Jewish Filmmakers and Writers as Critics of Power
Many of the most outspoken critics of Vladimir Putin’s Russia have been Russian Jewish journalists, novelists, and film directors. We will examine the modalities of non-conformism in the fiction of Gary Shteyngart, the films of Pavel Lounguine, and the trenchant political essays, blogs, and short stories of the sister and brother journalist team of
Masha and Keith Gessen. What are the key differences between the work of these public intellectuals and the dissent of political figures such as Garry Kasparov, Roman Abramovich and the late Boris Berezovsky? We will devote particular attention to Masha Gessen’s writing and activism in support of LGBT rights in Russia, and to Louguine’s two
films about assimilation, corruption and the legacy of Stalinism in Russia, Tycoon: A New Russian (2002) and Tsar (2009).

JLST 12 The Work of the Supreme Court: A Simulation (Same as SPEC 12)
(See under SPEC 12 for full description.)

JLST 13 United States Environmental Law: Its Historic Past, Its Uncertain Future (Same as ENVI 13)
Taught from the perspective of an experienced trial attorney, this course seeks to understand how we as Americans developed our consciousness towards the natural environment. What were the historical reasons why we treated the environment as we did during our travel westward from Jamestown in 1607 across 3,000 miles of unforgiving
wilderness, brutal desert and towering mountains to the Pacific Ocean?
The course traces the development of this American consciousness through an examination of our law and our literature. The term “law” includes state and federal judicial
decisions and legislation, beginning with the presidency of that “bully man,” Theodore Roosevelt, and continuing through the decades following the 1970s when much of the
legal basis for the American environmental protection movement was established. The term “literature” includes not just the written word (the first book we look at is “The
Lorax” by your favorite childhood author, Dr. Seuss) but also painting, sculpture, and music. Nothing too heavy! We will examine the historical and legal choices Americans
have made which have put our environment on trial. What in our development as a nation explains this quintessentially American phenomenon? While our journey begins with
the Puritans of New England and the planters of Virginia and their predecessors in the New World, we move swiftly to the beginning of the modern era of environmental law and
to its now uncertain future. During each class we will have a free-ranging discussion based upon a thorough examination of the materials assigned—historical texts, federal
environmental protection statutes, Supreme Court opinions interpreting those statutes (yes, Mr. Justice Antonin Scalia is long-winded, and he seriously believes he is the smartest
man on the Court (Chief Justice John Roberts is!), law review articles and texts, and current newspaper articles. There will be five one-page, single-spaced “clerk’s notes”
required covering historical periods (e.g., the transportation revolution in the 1790s, the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Manifest Destiny, the Gilded Age, the “trigger events”
leading to the flood of federal legislation beginning in 1970, and the like) designed to form the basis for each class’s discussion. We will challenge openly and freely everything
we have read, reviewed and written. I teach this course as if it were the first year of law school—questions come fast and furious to everyone, me included. My students in the past
seem to have enjoyed the give and take. No question is wrong, no question is right—until both are further examined.
This course will be presented from a litigator’s point of view, that is to say, both the practical and the theoretical, emphasizing what is possible to achieve in the litigator’s real
world as informed by what the academician would present from the security of the classroom.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, classroom participation and 5 one-page, single spaced papers called “clerk’s notes.”
No prerequisites.

JLST 17 Learning Intervention for Troubled Teens (LIFFT)
The objective of this program and winter study course is to provide an alternative sentence for adolescents involved in the Juvenile Court system in Berkshire County. Many of
these children cut school, are disruptive in the classroom, and do not find learning stimulating. The goal of this program is to teach these children, through experience, that
learning can be fun, providing them with the motivation to succeed in school. These students, under the guidance of Williams College undergraduates, will select a topic of
interest and learn how to research and present this topic to their peers in the program, with access to Williams College facilities. Williams undergraduate students will gain
experience in teaching and motivating troubled teenagers and will also present a topic of their choosing to the students in the program, modeling a classroom setting. Furthermore, Williams students will be exposed to the Juvenile Court system, gaining insight into the causes of and solutions to the incidence of juvenile crime. Williams students will be
expected to read relevant training materials, meet with their teenagers three times a week in the afternoon, give a final presentation, and keep a weekly journal detailing the
meetings.
Evaluation will be based on the quality of the journal and the Williams students’ own topic presentations.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 8.
Preference to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Students will be asked to write a paragraph describing why they want to take the course.

LEADERSHIP STUDIES
LEAD 10 Institutional Leadership and Social Responsibility
This course will examine a wide variety of issues related to leadership and responsibility, in both public- and private-sector settings. We will explore these issues through the
experiences of men and women who have held leadership roles in these contexts. We will look at issues of corruption and fraud in the private sector. We will examine the
changing role of lawyers in advising and guiding their clients. We will look at environmental issues from the perspective of both private institutions and government regulators.
We will discuss issues facing leaders in higher education. We will look at questions of responsibility facing political leaders at the state level in our federal system. And we will
examine leadership issues as they have arisen in historical contexts, including crucial questions regarding the origins and development of American involvement in Asia. The
majority of class sessions will be led by guest speakers, most, though not all, of whom are distinguished alumni of the college. Students will be expected to take an active role in
introducing and helping to lead discussions involving the guest speakers.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, preparation, and participation in class discussions, and a final 10-page paper. You should do the readings assigned before class. All
readings are online with the exception of one reading packet, which will be handed out in class, and one book. You are expected to purchase the latter, available at Water Street

LEAD 12 Three Roosevelt Elections
In the presidential election of 1932, as the country was plummeting to rock bottom in Great Depression, New York’s Democratic governor Franklin Roosevelt challenged
incumbent President Herbert Hoover. Four years later, in the election of 1936, FDR successfully defended his New Deal record against his Republican challenger, Governor Alf
Landon of Kansas. And in 1940, as European democracies fell one by one to the merciless Nazi onslaught and as American isolationists sought to appease Hitler, Roosevelt ran
for an unprecedented third term, the first and only president ever to do so.
In this course we will study these three consequential elections. After reading works of history for background, we will rely on primary source material—online data bases for
historical newspapers, news magazines, campaign speeches; polling data; diaries; memoirs—to understand and analyze the events, personalities, issues, and campaign strategies.
Requirements: students will give weekly class presentations and write one final paper.

MARITIME STUDIES
MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
MATH 10 A Revolution: Physical Mathematics
Through most of history, when math and science have interacted, it has overwhelmingly been the case that it is the mathematics that has shaped the science:

Mathematics ⇒ Science
In the early 1980s, the arrow was reversed, resulting in a profound change in how new mathematics is being discovered. This revolutionary approach is increasingly being called
Physical Mathematics. This course will be a popular introduction to this revolution. For example, we will explore the intimate link between how heat flows in a frying pan, how
stock prices change and how curvature of three dimensional objects can vary. We will also see how properties of real numbers have been discovered by examining the mathematics behind why ice melts. We will see the truly remarkable idea that understanding particle physics can explain how many conics are tangent to five fixed conic curves in the plane
(here the point is these two types of problems should have no obvious connection). Future generations will see Physical Mathematics as one of the key ideas of our era. This
course is aimed for people who want to get a feel for this revolution.
Evaluation will be based on problem sets and/or a 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: MATH 130 (formerly 103) or some knowledge of calculus or permission of the instructor.
Enrollment limit: 30. If overenrolled, students will be selected by interest in seeing how mathematicians discover new mathematics.
Cost: $30. for text.

include learning how to dance the Viennese waltz composed by Johann Strauss (in case you want to attend Austria’s main annual society event, the Opernball in Vienna) or how
to prepare Wienerschnitzel or bake Sachertorte (the delicious cake offered by the Hotel Sacher in Vienna). We will also pursue typical Austrian winter activities such as down hill
or cross country skiing, sledding or skating. The course will be conducted in both German and English.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, a 10-page paper (including presentation slides) and a corresponding presentation on a topic with an Austrian connection (possible topics
will be suggested, but students can choose their own) and class discussions.

MATH 12 The Mathematics of Legos
Since their introduction in 1949, Legos have challenged and entertained millions. In this course we’ll explore some of the connections between Legos, mathematics and popular
culture. Topics include the following:
1. Given a collection of Lego bricks, how many different structures may be built using only the standard snapping? The analysis requires us to develop some of the theory of
combinatorics, and deal with the issue of two configurations that look different but are the same after standard moves (such as rotation, flipping about a line, and so on). We will
use this problem as a springboard to study related issues in mathematics, especially in game theory.
2. Given a collection of Lego bricks, how can you build desired objects? This ranges from building miniature replicas to functional items (which can now be done through
‘special’ pieces).
3. The business model of the Lego Group has changed greatly since the ’40s and ’50s. While they still hold their products to the highest standard, the generic themes (such as city
and space) are now greatly supplemented by various alliances (Superheros, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, ...). We will examine some business cases involving Lego
in order to get a sense of how companies determine priorities, including a discussion of the recent Lego Friends line and gender issues.
4. One of the greatest computational advances is the ability to parallelize certain computations. Some programs must be run in order, where Step N cannot be done until Step N-1
is completed. Other problems, however, are such that multiple steps can be done simultaneously; examples include GIMPS (the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search), SETI,
mapping the human genome, factorizing numbers, and checking the Riemann Hypothesis. We will discuss the general theory of such computations and its effect on attacking
important problems. We will implement our skills by parallelizing the building of the LEGO Star Wars Superstar Destroyer; as it is 3152 pieces, we see the need of having a good,
efficient strategy if we are to complete it during the course!
Evaluation will be based on class participation, the completion of problem sets involving the mathematical concepts, a final report on one of the topics, and adherence to ‘Leg
Godt’
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Preference will be determined if needed by an application essay, interview and/or meeting.

MATH 14 An Introduction to the Chinese Tea Culture
Are you interested in the Chinese tea culture? It is not exaggerated to say that tea is a daily-life necessity in China: people drink tea in the morning, at work, and when hanging out
with friends and family. The Chinese tea tasting has a long history and profound meaning that is considered to be one of the treasures in the Chinese culture. Sometimes tea is
compared to personality: pleasant, elegant, low-keyed but long-lasting. This course introduces the five famous branches of Chinese tea: green tea, black tea, oolong tea, scented
tea, and compressed tea. Besides studying the history, geography, representative tea, production, nutrition, taste, and market price of different kinds of tea, students will learn how
to choose the matching tea wares to serve tea at various occasions, how to prepare tea in the traditional way so as to keep its best taste, etc. Students will have an opportunity to try
various tea purchased directly from China. In addition, each student will have hands-on experience to prepare tea and present his/her favorite Chinese tea in class. This course is a
combination of lectures, demonstrations, tea tasting, and films that are related to Chinese tea culture. Let’s heat up the water, make some tea, and enjoy!
Evaluation will be based on attendance, in-class participation, and a final 5-page paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: none. Interest in Chinese culture is assumed. (Speaking Chinese is not required but welcome).

MUS 10 Crime of the Century: The Kennedy Assassination
The goal of this course, offered in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, will be to provide students with a broad overview of
the wide ranging body of writing relating to the crime, including various assessments of the official explanation of events embodied in The Warren Commission Report.
We will begin by introducing targeted readings designed to introduce students to the basic historical context of the crime and the era in which it occurred. We will then explore
issues relating to the establishment of the facts of the case, as well as questions of motivation and opportunity. Who were the principal players alleged to have been involved, and
what relationships existed between them prior to the crime? Students will be expected to critically assess the various sources presented in the readings and films considered. What
were the agendas of those writing about the case?
The Dramatis Personae include the President, his brother and then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Mafia bosses Sam Giancana (Chicago) and Carlos Marcello (New
Orleans), FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald’s assassin Jack Ruby, among others.
Reading will average 200 pages a week from a reading packet created by the instructor, focusing on the controversy surrounding the findings and numerous critical rebuttals of
The Warren Commission Report, and including, besides the report itself, excerpts from biographies of the main players. These readings will be supplemented by a critical evaluation of the movie “JFK”, which students will be expected to watch on their own outside of class prior to class discussion, and two guest lectures by a retired journalist who has
studied the literature extensively. A representative sample of the many sources from which the reading packet material will be drawn are:

MUS 11 Tuning and Temperament
Our musical system conceals a fundamental flaw—an inherent, mathematical incommensurability of its intervals: a finite collection of tones cannot be built from pure fifths and
thirds and also be closed at the octave (i.e. twelve fifths from C returns not to another C, but to the distinct pitch B#). Equal temperament is our modern solution to this problem:
we make all fifths slightly impure, spreading the discrepancy between C and B# evenly among all intervals, thereby making the space between all tones exactly the same.
Historically, this was always not so; in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, myriad competing methods arose to distribute the discrepancy in uneven but usable ways. As a
result, different keys had different sounds—some were more harmonious, others less so; triads in those keys were not simply major or minor, but involved many shades of major
and minor. Drawing on ancient legends, writers ascribed specific characters to particular keys, and such key characters undoubtedly shaped composers’ choices: Mozart, for
instance, reserved g minor for particularly tragic topics; E-flat suggested particular paths for modulation by Bach. The class will explore the theory, the mythology, and most
importantly, the practice of diverse tuning systems from the Baroque era: much of the class work will involve learning how to tune a harpsichord, realizing various historical
temperaments on the instrument, and performing works thereupon in multiple keys, exploring the distinct sound worlds those temperaments create.
Requirements: final tuning project with demonstration and short paper.
Evaluation will be based on a student’s tuning project, and its accompanying presentation and paper.
Prerequisites: knowledge of basic musical rudiments (intervals, triads, keys).
Enrollment limit: 12.
Preference given to music majors, performers, and students who have taken a music theory course.

MUS 12 The Operas of Giuseppe Verdi
The operas of Giuseppe Verdi have long captivated audiences with their soaring melodies, dramatic intensity, patriotic sentiments, and spectacular effects. With works such as
Nabucco, La traviata, Rigoletto, Aida, and Otello, Verdi brought the 19th-century Italian operatic tradition to new aesthetic heights. Through lectures, discussion, and guided
listening, this course explores Verdi’s contribution to the field of opera by tracing the development of the Italian bel canto style and emergence of romantic naturalism in some of
his greatest masterworks. If possible, we will take a field trip to see a performance of a Verdi opera.
Evaluation will be based on two tests and class participation. Attendance is mandatory.
Prerequisites:: none. An ability to read music is not required.

MUS 13 History of American Popular Music
This course covers the development of American popular music from the birth of rock and roll in the 1950s to the music of the new millennium. This course will achieve two
main objectives. First, students will learn how to speak intelligently about popular music by discussing its salient characteristics such as song form, instrumentation, and aspects
of rhythm, melody, and harmony. Second, students will study connections between American popular music and significant cultural and political issues. Specifically, we will
focus on one significant cultural event during each week of the Winter Study period: the civil rights movement of the 1960s, censorship in the 1980s, copyright infringement at
the turn of the millennium, and musical responses to 9/11.
Concepts will be introduced primarily through lectures and listening, along with viewing of music videos and documentary excerpts.
Requirements: final paper (2500 words) and corresponding in-class presentation.
Evaluation will be based on completion of a final paper. Attendance and participation will also be taken into account.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 10 Food for Thought
This course will examine the philosophical, political and historical factors that underpin the American diet, how students’ day-to-day food choices affect the future of human life
on our planet, and finally, provide students with the basics of cooking. In part because I am a woman who broke through the ranks of a male-dominated profession, a corollary
discussion will occur about how sex-differentiated roles in the procurement and production of food came to be.
First, we will consider the history of four foods: spices from Asia, sugar from the Caribbean, potatoes from the Andes, and cod from the North Atlantic. Why were spices
important to Europeans? How did sugar contribute to the slave trade? How did the Andean potato contribute to the devastating effects of monoculture in Ireland? And finally,
how did the humble cod lead to the first settlement of Massachusetts by the English?
Second, we will learn about the food traditions and land usage of Native Americans from New England, and the effects the English arrival had on both. We will visit Historic
Deerfield and the Hancock Shaker Village for demonstrations of colonial daily life and technology of the 1700s and 1800s, respectively.
Third, we will consider the effect our modern food choices have on the future of human life. Students will choose a food and research the path it takes, the fossil fuels required,
and the hidden costs we charge to future generations, in order to bring it to our plates today.
Finally, as a chef and teacher, I would like to give young people basic cooking skills to provide them with confidence in the kitchen, and leave them with a desire to learn more
about why we eat what we eat.

PHIL 24 Eye Care and Culture on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua
In cooperation with Ray Hooker, President and founder of FADCANIC (the Foundation for the Autonomy and Development of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua) and optometrists from the New England College of Optometry, we prescribe and dispense reading and distance glasses to people in remote and often impoverished communities. In this, the
twelth iteration of the course, we will return to a number of small villages on the rim of Pearl Lagoon where we have not visited for 6 or 7 years, then head north to Wawashan, the
experimental school and from where students spend time in regular demanding high school classes and also learn how to tend their own farm when they graduate. If time and
weather permits we may spend the last day of our stay on a trip to the Pearl Keys for a day of relaxation and recuperation after 11 solid days of clinics and travel to widely
dispersed and seldom visited communities.
FADCANIC (The Foundation for Development and Autonomy on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua) headed by Ray Hooker will make the local arrangements for housing,
travel and exams.
Evaluation will be based on a journal and final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites; not open to first-year students.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Selection will be based on enthusiasm and preparation.
Cost: approximately $3000.
Meeting time: mornings.

PHIL 25 Morocco (Same as ENGL 25 and INST 26)
Students in this course will spend winter study in Morocco. Morocco presents a compelling blend of historical influences and modern world currents. Threads of Islam, Arab
traditions, and the heritage of the native Berber people are woven into a distinctive cultural tapestry, while traces of French colonialism can still be seen in the political and social
structure. Morocco is at the intersection of the West, the Middle East, and Africa. Travel there is therefore a powerful way to introduce intellectual themes that require and reward
a subtle blending of insight from history, political science, religion, philosophy, and literature. We will take the first steps in engaging some of these challenging topics in order to
enable independent study facilitated by serious and multifaceted exposure to the country. For the first two weeks, students will study at the Center for Cross Cultural Learning
(CCCL) in Rabat, taking lessons in Moroccan Arabic each morning and then gathering for lectures by local university faculty in the afternoon. During this span students will live
with Moroccan families in the Rabat medina. In the third week of the course students will travel in the interior of Morocco, exploring Fez and Marrakech, riding camels in the
desert, and hiking through Berber villages in the Atlas Mountains.
Requirements: students will be expected to attend all seminars, complete a substantial research paper (10-15 pages) before the trip begins on a facet of Moroccan culture, politics,
literature, or history, and complete a 5-page reflective addendum to the paper upon return.
Prerequisites: none; not open to first-year students. Arabic is the official spoken language of Morocco, and French is spoken widely. While desirable, neither is required.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Preference: student interest is more important than class year or academic major. Final selection will be based on one-page essays from all applicants explaining their interest in
the course and any relevant background.
Estimated cost: $4200.

PHYSICS
PHYS 10 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level appropriate for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical
background in lectures and discussion. Demonstrations will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the lab. Thanks to a grant from the National
Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography darkrooms available for student use. At the beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and discussion three
mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a week. The later part of the month will be mainly open laboratory time during which students, working in small groups, will conduct an
independent project in holography approved by the instructor. Attendance at lectures and laboratory is required.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises, and a holography laboratory project with either a poster presentation to the class at the end
of WSP or a 10-page paper approved by the instructor. Attendance at all classes and labs is required for a passing grade.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 30.
Preference to students with no physics above Physics 109; then seniors, juniors, sophomores and first-years.
Cost: $50 for holographic film and chemicals.

PHYS 12 Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift, but a learnable skill. If you wanted to draw, but have never had the time to learn; or you enjoy drawing and wish to deepen your
understanding and abilities, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes traditional drawing exercises to teach representational drawing. By using simple techniques
and extensive exercises you will learn to see more accurately and realistically represent the physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, interior, and still life. This
course is designed to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which are applicable in any field. Students need no previous
artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a new skill.
Requirements: students will be expected to attend and participate in all class sessions as well as mandatory study sessions in museums once a week. They will also be required to
keep a sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project. Evaluations will be based on participation, effort, and development. All class sessions are mandatory as
well as one session per week at the Clark and Williams College Museums.

PHYS 13 3D Printer Construction: Beyond the Basics
3D printing is a technology used to create three dimensional objects from digital information. During Winter Study 2013, students built and operated the first 3D printer on the
Williams campus. The printer is a “RepRap,” based on an open-source project aimed at developing a self-replicating 3D printer. In this course, we will design and build hardware
to extend the applications and capabilities of the RepRap 3D printer. We will modify the printer to a dual print-head design. With two heads, the printer will be capable of creating
objects with two different materials, or printing at different resolutions. The second printing extruder can also print a water soluble, thermo-plastic support structure, enabling the
construction of items with overhangs and complex designs. Separately, we will fabricate a plastic filament extruder that will manufacture low-cost printing filament from raw
materials, including recycled plastics. In the final week, we will concentrate on creating complex, functional or artistic objects from our own CAD designs, culminating with a
presentation of the hardware and objects. The printer and filament extruder created by the class will remain in the Bronfman Science Shop, available throughout the year to
support faculty and student projects.
Requirements: attendance and participation, final public presentation.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Preference based on one paragraph explanation of student’s basis for interest in the course.

PHYS 17 The Science of Musical Sound
How and why do instruments sound the way they do? What makes a violin and a piano sound different, even when they are playing the same note? How does our physiology
affect our perception of musical sounds? This course is intended as an introduction to the acoustics of music, especially for non-scientists with an interest in the subject. We will
discuss the origin of sound waves and the meaning of musical pitch and tone, as well as the diverse ways in which musical instruments generate musical sound. There will also be
lab sessions in which we will study sounds produced by a variety of objects and instruments. All necessary mathematics, physics, and musical background will be provided
during the lectures, discussions, and labs (two hours total per day, four days per week).
Requirements: a final 6- to 10-page paper on a topic of the student’s choice, and a 15-minute oral presentation on the subject to the class.
Prerequisites: pre-calculus level mathematics. Some knowledge of musical notation will be useful but is not necessary. This course is not suitable for students who have previously taken PHYS 109.

POLITICAL ECONOMY
POEC 17 Social Entrepreneurship: Innovating in the Social Sector (Same as ECON 17 and LEAD 17)
Operating as consultants, students will work in small teams to develop and present solutions to “client” organizations seeking assistance. Clients will be innovative social enterprises in areas such as education, health care, job creation, and food and nutrition, as well as investors that allocate growth capital to them, e.g. foundations and community
development financial institutions. Some of the participating organizations will be local. Others will likely be based in New York City. Examples of projects that student teams
might tackle include how to position a product or service to generate income and thereby reduce reliance on grants and donations, or how to enhance the social impact of a
particular type of programming. Students will assemble and analyze relevant information and, at the end of the course, present findings and recommendations to senior officials
of the client organizations. The class will visit New York toward the end of the month. The emphasis of the consulting work will be creative, experience-based problem-solving in
the social sector.
Classroom discussion will focus on the circumstances of participating organizations, including their financial models, organizational structures and governance arrangements. In
addition, readings and guest speakers will address trends in the fields of social entrepreneurship and impact investing more broadly.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, contribution to team projects, the quality of written and oral presentations, and the value of the input that students provide to the
clients.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 20.
If overenrolled, selection will be based on a statement of your interest in the course and what you hope to gain from it.
Cost: $250 (for trip to NYC for final presentations and other meetings).

POLITICAL SCIENCE
PSCI 11 The Great American Novel
In the aftermath of the Civil War, a writer and critic remarked that the “task of painting the American soul within the framework of a novel has seldom been attempted.” By the
dawn of the 21st century, the same statement could hardly be made seriously. From Fitzgerald to Faulkner, Steinbeck to Salinger, McCarthy to Morrison, writers of all ages,
traditions, and subjects have sought—often in vain—to write something akin to a national epic, a story of America and Americans that captures the zeitgeist of its time with
precision, emotion, and depth. Far from a historical survey of all those who have tried, this course is about contenders for the title of The Great American Novel in our time—literally in your reading lifetime. What defines or consumes the American spirit—American life, American existence—today? What features and forces structure our days and
shape our destinies? What kinds of enthusiasms push us forward as individuals, and what kinds of anxieties hold us back as a people? We will consider these questions in the
context of award-winning and critically-acclaimed books written in America during the past two decades about America of the past two decades, each of which has been hailed
(by someone or another) as a nominee for The Great American Novel. Among the possibilities—from which three will be chosen at a later date—are Michael Chabon’s Telegraph Avenue, Junot Diaz’s The Brief Wonderful Life of Oscar Wao, Chitra Divakaruni’s One Amazing Thing, Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, Dave Eggers’s A
Hologram for the King, Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, Dinaw Mengetsu’s The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears, Karen Russell’s Swamplandia!, Richard Russo’s
Empire Falls, and David Foster Wallace’s The Pale King. Along the way, students will select a fourth book for individual reading and assessment as we seek to uncover the
essence of our national identity and the challenges of those who dare to imagine it with words.
Requirements: class participation and a 10- to 12-page paper.

PSCI 15 Education Reform: Is it Innovation or Destruction? (Same as HIST 15)

PSCI 16 Aikido and the Peaceful Warrior
“I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory - I love only that which they defend” Faramir, from Tolkien’s The Lord
of the Rings.
War and Peace. Conflict and Compassion. The archetype of the Peaceful Warrior weaves together the potentially contradictory elements of battlefield prowess with a protective
and compassionate embrace of culture and community. Modern leaders, whether political, military, scientific, or corporate, earn our admiration for their successful integration of
these same contradictory elements. Indeed, not having both of these elements simultaneously at work renders us suspicious of their intentions or capacity.
The only way to understand how both war and peace can exist coherently within one individual is to experience it first-hand. The course therefore combines daily martial arts
training with peacemaking exercises, a quest journal, and an academic exploration of the Peaceful Warrior figure in both literature and history.
The martial arts training will be every morning in Currier Ballroom, and will be in Aikido — a Japanese martial tradition that combines the samurai arts of sword and grappling
with the philosophical desire to manifest harmony in the face of conflict. As such, Aikido addresses situations of conflict that manifest themselves physically, but also offers
insight into how to prevent or redirect the energies - social, political, or psychological — that might otherwise become conflict in one or another aspect of our lives. The physical
training will improve each student’s strength, balance, posture, and flexibility. Everyone will also learn how to throw their friends across the room. About 25% of training time
will be devoted to sword, staff, and dagger techniques.
The academic component of the course will survey the Peaceful Warrior archetype with specific reference to both historical and literary examples —from Arthur’s knights,
Charlemagne’s paladins, Islamic mujahedeen, Buddhist warrior monks, UN Peacekeepers, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King to Odysseus, Cyrano, the Lone Ranger,
Kwai Chang Caine, Aragorn, and Obi Wan Kenobi. Besides readings, class discussions, and regular film screenings, students will maintain a quest journal that documents the
saga of their search for . . . whatever they decide their holy grail actually is. Additional relevant experiences, such as meditation practice and an all-night vigil, will be woven into
the course experience.
By integrating physical and intellectual components, the course seeks to forge in each student a more coherent perspective on the challenges of leadership and personal integrity.
The course also seeks to provide an opportunity for students to imagine and articulate what full commitment to an integrated, powerful, and ethical life would be like, and for one
intensive month, to live it.
Candidates need to understand that this course requires more commitment than many Winter Study options. There is simply no other way to transmit and integrate the course’s
physical and intellectual components. Students will be expected to want to immerse themselves in a month of peaceful warrior apprenticeship. While this will not resemble boot
camp in any conventional sense, it needs to be intense in order to succeed.
Students will be evaluated on the quality of their participation in both physical and intellectual course components (class discussions, quest journal, final project) Students are
encouraged to correspond with the instructor (rkent-at-williams.edu) before registration begins if they have questions.
Prerequisites: same physician’s approval on file as the school requires to participate on sports teams. Students do not have to be especially athletic, and in Aikido women train as
equals with men.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost: approximately $135 for uniform and wooden training weapons, books, etc..
Meeting time: Aikido sessions from 10-12. Academic Classes typically over lunch and occasional evenings.

Compared to wars, infectious diseases and public health crises have consistently accounted for the greatest proportion of human morbidity and mortality. For instance, of the 50
million deaths recorded in 1990, infectious diseases claimed about 17 million compared with 322,000 from war. However, how disease and public health crises have shaped the
course of human history is not often taken seriously. Through scholarly work and documentaries, this course considers the longstanding effect of infectious diseases and public
health crises on human development.

PSCI 19 Same-Sex Marriage in America (Same as WGSS 19)
Most young Americans today support same-sex marriage not only as good public policy but as an obvious civil right emergent from the demands of justice and equality. Yet only
twenty-five years ago same-sex marriage was not simply rejected overwhelmingly by nearly all Americans; it was a thought nearly impossible to think. How did same-sex
marriage travel so much social terrain so rapidly? Why did something virtually unthinkable in the 1980s and roundly rejected across the political spectrum in the 1990s become
the epitome of enlightened thought by the 2010s?
This class builds on and is informed by the instructor’s current book project “Beyond Tolerance,” an investigation into the cultural, social and political factors which have made
same-sex marriage in America. The goal of the course is to explain and understand the recent history of incorporating same-sex couples into the institution of marriage—NOT to
debate same-sex marriage on legal or ethical grounds (if you are hoping to argue over the Supreme Court’s 2013 opinions re California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of
Marriage Act, this is not the course for you). Students in the course will investigate changing cultural evaluations of both homosexuality and marriage; the social geography of
these cultural changes; and the political stakes involved in being on the winning or losing side in this most pitched ‘culture war’ battle.
Requirements: 10-page final paper.

PSCI 20 Derrida’s Greatest Hits (PHIL 20)
Despite, or perhaps because of, the notorious difficulty of his writing, Jacques Derrida was in his final decades probably the world’s most famous living philosopher. He was also
extraordinarily controversial—hailed as a great thinker by some but denounced by others as a charlatan whose works could not reasonably be called “philosophy.” In this class,
we will engage a handful of the most significant and widely discussed essays by this influential yet fiercely contested figure. Although the course is not a comprehensive examination of Derrida’s thought, it should introduce some of the pleasures, perplexities, and frustrations of his way of reading and writing. We will pay particular attention to how
Derrida can inform thinking about problems of politics and ethics, but our primary task will simply be to read him as well as we can, taking the difficulty of the texts as a challenge
to be worked through and a spur to developing our own, independent assessments. Likely course materials include Derrida: the Movie, “Structure, Sign, and Play,” “. . . That
Dangerous Supplement. . .,” “Differance,” “Plato’s Pharmacy,” “Signature, Event, Context,” “Declarations of Independence,” and sections of Specters of Marx or Rogues, as
well as related excerpts from Plato, Rousseau, Jefferson, Austin, and Searle.
Evaluation based on regular, informed class participation and two 5-page papers.
Prerequisites: some prior work in political theory, philosophy, or literary theory.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public Affairs and Private Non-Profits (Same as POEC 21)
This course is a participant-observation experience in which students work full-time for a governmental or nongovernmental (including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization or for a political campaign. Students may find placements in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant involvement with public
issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices (e.g., environmental agencies, housing authorities); interest groups that lobby government (e.g., ACLU, NRA); nonprofit organizations such as service providers or think tanks (e.g., Habitat for Humanity, Cato Institute); and grassroots, activist or community
development organizations (e.g., Greenpeace or neighborhood associations). The instructors will work with each student to arrange a placement; such arrangements must be
made in advance of the Winter Term. Students should first make their own contracts with an institution or agency. The instructors and members of the Political Science Department are available to help students find placements, if necessary. Each student’s fieldwork mentor shall send a confirmation letter to the instructor verifying the placement and
describing the nature of the work to be performed by the instructor, and write a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting of all students will
occur after winter study to discuss the experience.
Requirements: 90 hours of fieldwork; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper or equivalent; participation in final meeting. At the time of
preregistration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Paula Consolini.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 30.
Selection will be based on a resume and letter of interest.

PSCI 25 In Collaboration with the Bard Prison Initiative—Going Wild: Nature in the Political Imagination
This course examines a classic theme in political theory—the naturalness of politics—in an unusual classroom setting—a maximum security prison in NY. Members of the
seminar will be drawn in equal numbers from Williams College and from the Bard Prison Initiative, a program that allows incarcerated adults to pursue college degrees while
serving their sentences. Together, we will linger with several important works of political thinking and discuss how their various accountings of nature inflect the political
sensibilities they promote.
Theorists, artists, and scientists who have sought to imagine what is possible or desirable in politics often devote special attention telling stories about or picturing nature, even if
they describe politics as something artificial, nature’s ostensive opposite. Works of political theory, literature, film and art have imagined nature as politics’ origin (which must be
surpassed to found politics, yet can never be fully left behind), politics’ mirror (in which politics is both distorted and reflected), or politics’ foundation (at once stabilizing and
destabilizing). At times, nature emerges in the political imagination as the wild pressing in at the edges of political order, and at times it is figured as the ordering law to which
politics should (but perhaps never fully does) conform. Focal points for our discussion may include readings/screenings of: Hobbes’s Leviathan, Thoreau’s Walden, Jane Bennett’s Vibrant Matter, Franz de Waal’s Chimpanzee Politics, episodes of the series Lost, and Benh Zeitlin’s film Beasts of the Southern Wild.
The seminar will meet 4-5 times per week for two-hour blocks of time at Eastern Correctional, in Ellenville, NY, within the prison’s school area. In addition to approximately six
students from Williams, the class will enroll approximately six students from Eastern who are pursuing a degree from Bard College through the Bard Prison Initiative
(http://bpi.bard.edu/). BPI students will be equal partners in class discussions and be graded on the basis of identical requirements. In addition to these structured seminar meetings, 1-2 “study hall” sessions per week at Eastern will be arranged for students to collaborate informally on the course’s subject matter. Williams students enrolled in the course
will lodge for the duration of Winter Study in New Paltz, a college town with many local amenities approximately 35 minutes from Eastern. Transportation between New Paltz
and Eastern by van will be arranged for each class and “study hall” session.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, regular short response pieces, and a final paper of 10-15 pages.
Prerequisites: permission of instruction via a selection process; participation in orientations at Eastern and at Williams in the Fall semester; security screening and fingerprinting
by Eastern
Enrollment limit: 6; not open to first-year students.
Preference: instructor’s selection, conducted in part through a brief written application.

PSYC 11 Community Screening for Alzheimer’s Disease
This course will consider memory screening as a strategy to address the increasing prevalence and importance of early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease in Williamstown and
surrounding communities. Through readings and class presentations/discussions, students will become familiar with research on the epidemiology and underdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, neuropsychological screening instruments for Alzheimer’s disease, and the design and analysis of screening instruments. Students will learn how to administer
and interpret neuropsychological instruments used to screen for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The class will then design and conduct a community screening day for AD. This will
include selecting appropriate screening instruments, selecting an appropriate venue, raising community awareness of memory problems, and working with local community
agencies to encourage individuals to participate in memory screening. Following the screening day, each student will analyze the data collected on the screening day and submit a
report.

PSYC 13 Economic Justice Dialogue
Economic justice, broadly defined, has become a paramount concern of our time, whether evidenced by the fervor of Occupy protests last year, revolutions in the Mideast,
unprecedented inequality of income and wealth in the U.S., gutting of jobs and speedup of those that remain (productivity gains going to capital not labor), declining living
standards, impoverishment of the “formerly middle class”-and by the burst of new college colleges on economic inequality and the history and culture of capitalism. At the same
time, Americans have usually felt inhibited about discussing issues of class and economic inequality.
How can we learn to talk about economic justice in a meaningful, enlightened, sensitive, and nondefensive way, so that citizens can truly listen to each other and honestly
consider conflicting views, seeking common ground wherever feasible?
The rise of humanistic psychology after World War II helped to usher in a generation of concern about people’s communication capability and the prevalence of miscommunication and misunderstanding in an increasingly complex world. The influence of Carl Rogers et al dovetailed with the humanistic dialogue practices of Myles Horton and the
Highlander Folk School; bottom-up communication pioneered by Ella Baker, Bob Moses, and Danilo Dolci; citizenship education schools in the South; Paulo Freire’s popular
education and “pedagogy of the oppressed”; open communication theories of Jurgen Habermas; and recently the thriving school of “nonviolent communication.”
In this course we will apply a mosaic of these communication and dialogue practices (most of which the instructor has practiced in teaching and organizing), in order to engage in
honest, open, and knowledgeable dialogues about economic justice at home and around the world. Students will commit to engaging in this structured dialogue process, studying
the readings, and writing a paper on their experience of communicating humanistically about economic justice.
Assignments: course reader, daily internet posts, blogs, and video segments, video of dialogues.
Requirements: 10-page paper or final project.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 15.

REL 10 Hearts, Hands, and Minds
The class is presented under the auspices of the Chaplains Office in cooperation with the Center for Learning In Action. Lead instructor is Cantor Bob Scherr, assisted by Imam
Bilal Ansari, Father Gary Caster, and the Rev. Rick Spalding.
We will focus on two work/service projects tbd, centered in Berkshire County, during the 3 1/2 weeks. Students will be immersed in the perspectives of Christianity (Catholic and
Protestant), Islam, and Judaism on the intersection of theology, ethics, faith and service. Lectures and presentations, by the course instructors and guests, and class discussions
will be informed by readings; works under consideration for inclusion include Ian Markham, A Theology of Engagement; Rabbi Jill Jacobs, There Shall Be No Needy; Eboo
Patel, Acts of Faith; Martin Marty, When Faiths Collide; Diana Eck, Encountering God; Miroslav Volf, Allah, a Christian Response. Regular experiences of the worship and
spiritual practice of adherents to these faiths will also help to facilitate learning about the their theology, practices, communities, and commitments to community service and
repairing the world.
The experiential component of the course will include work on one, or perhaps two, local service projects, perhaps shared with local residents, which will enable us to put our
hands onto the community in which we live, informed and motivated by our understanding of these faith perspectives. Working locally will enable us to connect more deeply to
the community in which we live. The course will also include an overnight visit each week to inter-faith communities in the New York, New Haven and Boston metropolitan
areas—including the Community of Living Traditions in Stony Point, NY; Hartford Seminary; and the Center for a New Economy in New Haven, CT—where inter-religious
dialogue informs both the practice of faith and also work to improve the community. Students and instructors will also take part in the MLK Day of Service.
The course will conclude with a Celebration of Learning and Service, a public inter-faith expression.
Requirements: students will be required to keep a journal of reflections throughout the course; a final 10 to 15-page integrative paper will be due before the beginning of the

REL 14 Yoga as Integration of Knowledge and Practice
Many have encountered yoga as a popular form of purely physical exercise. In this course we approach yoga differently as an interconnected system of embodied and philosophical knowledge. We practice alignment based Hatha yoga poses, breathing exercises and meditation. These yogic practices are informed by our study of two classic Indian yoga
texts, The Yoga Sutras and The Bhagavad Gita.
Through the synergistic combination of yogic practice and study, we investigate the nature of consciousness and the self. In personal reflection as well as practice, discussion and
group exercises, we explore the ethical implications of yoga in daily life. Thus the overarching orientation of the course is two-fold: an introversive self discovery through
immersion in a deep tradition of yogic knowledge and practice, and extroversively a clarified personalized vision and supporting set of practices about negotiating a life in the
world.
Required Texts: The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Bhagavad Gita.
Evaluation is based on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, a personal practice journal, one short reflection paper (2 pgs.), and a ten page final paper focusing
on the relationship between textual study and yoga practice. To earn a passing grade, students must complete all practice hours and assignments.
Prerequisites: previous study in philosophy and/or yoga asana (poses) is welcome but not required.

RLFR 16 Contemporary Queer Cinema in France (Same as WGSS 16)
From the streets of “Gay Paris” to the cinematic premieres of the Cannes Film Festival, France has long been a beacon of queer representation. French writers from Gide and
Proust to Colette and Genet celebrated gay and lesbian identities in their novels. American expatriates Gertrude Stein and Natalie Barney mentored new generations of queer
artists and writers in their Parisian salons. And openly gay couturiers Jean-Paul Gaultier and Yves Saint-Laurent projected fabulous French fashion out into the world. In the past
few decades, queer political activism in France has led to the creation of greater rights and protections for GLBT citizens, including the national domestic partnership law
(PACS), effective health care for people living with HIV/AIDS, and the controversial victory for marriage equality in 2013. This course will examine representations of gay,
lesbian, bisexual, and transgender identity in French cinema from 1968 to 2014. We will discuss a wide variety of issues on queer cinematic representation, including the closet
and coming-out, race and ethnicity, lesbian (in)visibility, bisexuality, transgender identity, butch-femme and drag performativity, queer political engagement, and HIV/AIDS. Our
film discussions will be complemented by readings from contemporary French and American queer theory. Films to include works by Balasko, Berliner, Chabrol, Collard,

RLSP 12 Spain in Film: Introduction to Spanish Cinema and Film Analysis (Same as COMP 12)
This course introduces students to Peninsular Spanish film through the viewing and analysis of representative works, from Buñuel’s first pictures to the present. The purposes of
the course are: 1) to familiarize students with Spanish film history, including canonical and lesser-known directors and works, major aesthetic trends, and the effects of censorship; 2) to examine how various forms of identity (national, regional, class, and gender), are represented in film, and how works have challenged monolithic models of identity; 3)
to introduce students to the analysis of film, specialized vocabulary, and close-reading techniques; 4) to expand students’ knowledge of the historical events that have transformed
Spain in the 20th and 21st centuries: the arrival of the second republic, the Civil War, the Franco dictatorship, the transition to democracy and the “state of autonomous regions,”
the recent efforts to recover historical memory, the massive influx of immigration, and the current economic crisis.
The class will be conducted in English, and we will watch only films with subtitles.

This course takes a close look at life and issues along the US-Mexico border, specifically the border with Arizona. The first week (on campus) will be devoted to investigating the
political economy of immigration, cultural flows and identities in both social science and literary contexts, social transformations and domestic political coalitions, political and
economic treaties, security concerns, and US immigration policy and practice, all with specific reference to US-Mexican immigration. The objective is to provide students with
background and references in preparation of their experiential learning in Arizona and Mexico. The two-week travel portion of the course will be organized through Borderlinks,
a non-profit that specializes in educational programs in the Arizona/Mexico borderlands (www.borderlinks.org/). Students will extend their understanding of the immigration
issues on-site with the Borderlinks delegation and profit from an intense experiential leaming component where they have exchanges with migrants, youth groups, humanitarian
activists, and community organizations in Arizona and neighboring Mexico. There will also be a service component in Arizona and/or Mexico with non-profit groups involved in
border issues. There will be several films on migration and the performative border. Upon their return to campus, students will meet with the instructors to evaluate their experience in light of the reading they did before departing. Each student will complete a 10-page paper on some facet of US-Mexico immigration and the borderlands.
Requirements: 10-page paper.
No prerequisites; not open to first-year students.
Enrollment limit: 10.

RUSS 13 Organized Crime in Contemporary Culture (Same as COMP 13)
The subcultures of organized crime groups in countries as different as Mexico, Italy, the United States, Russia, Japan and India manifest striking similarities in their social and
political attitudes and folkways. In this course we will examine the self-consciously romanticized, demonized or pointedly de-glamorized images of organized crime in politics,
literature, and cinema across the contemporary global village. Why do political ideologies that emphasize the inflexible rule of law and tight control of the media often express a
fascination with traditional forms of systemic illegality? In attempting to answer this question, we will examine the ways in which literary, cinematic, journalistic and internet
texts portray the lives of organized crime workers within the international marketplace, and how the presence of such individuals reflect the increasingly symbiotic economic
relations across the globe.
Requirements: one 10- to 12-page paper, and two oral presentations.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Preference to Comparative Literature, English and Russian majors.
Cost of books $60.
Meeting times: MWTh 10-noon.

THEATRE
THEA 10 Life of Pie
From the origins of “four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie,” in the entremets entertainments of medieval banquets, to the iconic Christmas table as set by Charles Dickens
with its mincemeat pies, the pastry-crust pie has a storied history and potent symbolism, especially in British and American consciousnesses. This course will trace the development of this ancient foodstuff using Janet Clarkson’s Pie: A Global History, supplemented by other historical readings. Paired with this we will examine how the pie has been
represented artistically, whether the macabre meat pies of Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd, Gary Ross’s critique of mid-century, “American as mom and apple pie” establishment
culture in his film Pleasantville, or Ned the Piemaker (and raiser of the dead) in Brian Fuller’s charming zombie romance, Pushing Daisies. But primarily we will bake pies. Lots
of pies, sweet and savory, all from scratch. We will learn the basics of making pastry crusts, filling preparation, assembly and decoration, baking and final presentation. Students
will be expected to document their process-and the resulting pies!-on a class blog. Recipes used will draw inspiration from history, novels and film, culminating in a medieval
costume banquet of sweet and savory pies at which we will show off our baking prowess to friends and colleagues.
Requirements: students will be evaluated on overall class participation, homework, and involvement in the planning and execution of the final banquet during the last week of the
course.
Prerequisites: no prior cooking experience is necessary, though some knowledge is helpful and a desire to learn is mandatory.
Enrollment limit: 10.
If overenrolled, selection will be based on a short essay and background.
Cost: approximately $150 for books and reading packets, cooking supplies and ingredients.
Meeting time: afternoons, 6-9 hours/week for discussion, kitchen sessions, and food tasting. An additional 8-12 hours/week of work outside of class should be expected, to
include reading, film watching, and food preparation.

THEA 17 How To Be a Princess: A Performance Studio Course (Same as WGSS 17 and COMP 17)
This Winter Study performance studio course will give you the tools and experience you need to be a princess or, at least, fake it really well. Over the course of the studio, you will
research, write, build, and act in your own “Princess Play,” based on either a real or imagined princess. For some guidance, we’ll explore the role of the princess in theatre,
popular media, and performance. What is a princess? What do princesses do? What are their props? What are their unique struggles and hardships? How do they do their hair?
What makes them tick? For inspiration, we’ll read a few plays—Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour’s Lost, Kleist’s Penthesilea, Yeats’ Diarmuid and Grania, Williams’ Sweet Bird of
Youth, and Jelinek’s Princess Plays. We’ll also study the role of princesses in more contemporary media: South Korean TV drama, Disney’s Princess films and dolls, and The
Princess Diaries. Most importantly, we’ll study the lives and of real princesses, such as Princess Nandi Zulu and Princess Kate Middleton.
Requirements: oral presentations of research, individual project work, and final presentation of an original creative performance in a public setting.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 10.
Theatre, Comparative Literature, and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies majors will be given preference.
Cost: $12.

Join us on an exploratory research mission to uncover the hidden side of the Berkshires. We’ll travel together to visit archives, museums, libraries, private homes, and other
historical sites to interview local historians, curators, librarians, and residents about the sex lives of Berkshire’s historical and literary figures, whether famous, infamous, or
heretofore unknown. We will locate archives and collections, which students will examine for relevant information, stories, and traces. In particular, we are looking for figures
who were somehow on the sexual margins of society—e.g., independent women and feminist pioneers, adulteresses, outlaws, prostitutes, gender-nonconforming or LGBT
figures. We’ll also be looking into lesser known aspects of our more famous residents, including Herman Melville, Cole Porter, W.E.B. Dubois, Susan B. Anthony, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, and Edith Wharton among others to be determined by the group, examining the passions, romances and affairs that shaped their legacies. (Along the way, we’ll read
some works by some of these people as well.) And we’ll talk about the diverse cultures shaping the sexual landscape of the Berkshires, ranging from celibate Shakers to the
debauched “bath tub parties” of millionaire residents in the Guilded Age. We will collectively discuss how the resources we discover together might be transformed into a future
seminar, allowing students in this winter course to work with faculty and local experts from the community to build a foundation for a new class and to shape an integrated
curriculum for future Williams students.
Most days (Monday through Thursday) we will leave at 10 a.m. and drive to surrounding areas, returning by 4 pm. Owing to inclement weather and the changing schedules of
our interlocutors, we may not use all of these available days or we may meet on campus for a shorter time to plan our projects, discuss materials, etc. The schedule is necessarily
elastic, but students are expected to reserve this time and to attend all of our field trips.
Requirements: one annotated bibliography, short informal presentation/summary, active participation.

SPECIALS
SPEC 10 Intentional Communities and the American College
The exponential growth of opportunities for higher education in a low-cost online environment has presented an existential question to residential colleges and universities. What
additional value does a traditional collegiate experience provide given the enormous cost of such an education? Williams College President Adam Falk partially answered that
question when he spoke about the unique pedagogic value of human-to-human interaction in didactic learning. What Falk did not address, but is of equal importance, is the role
of a college as an intentional community that teaches its members how to live in community.
While this has always been important, the need for such an education is greater now than it ever has been. As Robert Putnam has written, many of the mediating institutions of
society have disappeared from the contemporary culture. More students than ever before never have experienced a neighborhood, their families are not members of civic organizations and if they attend a house of worship, frequently even that institution no longer acts as much of a locus for community life.
The last, and often the only opportunity for young people to live in community is when they live in a residential institution of higher learning. The use of the word “in” rather than
“at” is deliberate. Merely renting a room from a college or university does not make it a residential community. To establish that requires a deliberate creation of a healthy, vibrant
community. More than ever, the college or university cannot assume that the students who arrive in September of their first year have any idea what it is to live in community. The
university or college needs to understand that in many ways it has to undertake remedial education in socialization. To do so does not mean the creation of a set of rigid juridical
standards that are enforced by the threat of sanctions; rather, it requires the same intentional instruction that is the hallmark of great intellectual education.
If living in community is not a part of each student’s education, then that would amount to cheating her or him of much of what a collegiate experience should provide. It will
mean that the student will be, even if well taught in the classroom, unprepared for living within the polis.
By establishing this as an overt goal of a collegiate education provides the mechanism for re-configuring colleges to accomplish this task. While establishing these goals needs to
be done with students and the administration, in the need the creation and maintenance of community falls, as it should, on the faculty’s shoulders. Faculty members should be
selected and promoted with an eye to whether they contribute to teaching on how to live in community. It means as well that much of the responsibility for the running of the
institution needs to be returned to the faculty from burgeoning administrative staffs.
This requires a return back to an older understanding of the role of the institution and faculty of higher education. It is a rejection of the German model that was imported at the
end of the Ninetieth Century. To do that will require the leadership as well of trustees and officers, as the metrics used to measure such institutions by the government, accrediting
institutions or the media do not value the contributions of community building and mentorship.
In this course, we will look briefly at the history of higher education from its monastic beginnings through the development of the research university model to the present. We
will examine the need for teaching how to live in community and different models of intentional communities that may have saliency in their adaptation to the collegiate environment. Finally, we will look at what changes within the institutions would be required to implement such an educational goal.
Students will read selections from Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone, John Thelin’s A History of American Higher Education, Ricahrd DeMillo’s Abelard to Apple, Dianne Gereluk’s Education and Community, Parker Palmer and Arthur Zajonc’s The Heart of Higher Education: A Call to Renewal, Benjamin Ginsberg’s The Fall of the Faculty: the Rise
of the All-Administrative University and Why it Matters, Frank Donoghue’s The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities, as well as Andrew
Delbanco’s College: What it Was, Is and Should Be.
Photocopies of the readings will be provided to the students shortly after registration at no cost.
Students will be evaluated both on their contributions to the discussion as well as three short (4-6 pages) papers on the readings.

SPEC 12 The Work of the Supreme Court: A Simulation (Same as JLST 12)
The objective of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the personal, theoretical, and institutional characteristics that impact the decision making process of
the nation’s highest court. At the beginning of the course, the students will be provided with briefs, relevant decisions and other materials for a case currently pending before the
court. Where possible, cases will be selected that address constitutional issues that also have a political and/or historical significance. Past examples include the rights of prisoners
held in Guantanamo, the extent of First Amendment rights of students, and the applicability of the State Secrets doctrine to the country’s extraordinary rendition program. Four
students (two on each side) will be assigned to prepare and present oral arguments to the “Court”, which will consist of the other eight students, each playing the role of a Supreme
Court Justice. An instructor will act as the Chief Justice to coordinate the student Justices and keep them on focus. After the oral argument, the “Court” will confer and prepare
majority and minority opinions, which will be announced in “open court” at the conclusion of the term.
Evaluations will be based on the student’s preparation for and performance of their assigned role, and upon a 5-page paper discussing the subjects covered by the course.

SPEC 13 Facing Violent Crime
Television, movies, and video games bombard us with fictional depictions of violent crime and the consequences of victims’ responses. But what is violent crime really like?
What do we know about different types of violent criminals? What are the most effective ways to avoid and deter violent crime? If you do become a victim, what are the most
effective ways to avoid injury? Should you resist? If so, how? In this course we will read and discuss theories of crime and criminals, research using data from sources such as the
National Crime Victimization Survey, and expert recommendations for personal safety and self-defense. (Note: This is not a hands-on self-defense training course.)
Requirements: 10-page paper.

This course will focus on learning how to write and perform songs in a contemporary style. Topics addressed will include song structure, how to create a lyric that communicates,
vocal and instrument presentation, performing techniques, publicity for events, and today’s music industry. This class will culminate in a public performance of material written
during the course. To successfully pass this course, students are required to create, edit, perform and possibly record two original songs. These songs must be conceived during
the course period (previously written material is not usable). Students will be guided to create both music and lyrics. They may also be required to participate in a co-write session.
At least one of these songs will be presented during the final performance, preferably by the student. Attendance at classes, feedback sessions, and all officially scheduled events
is mandatory. A short writing assignment based on the assigned reading will be passed in on the last day of class.
No pre-requisites. Students with a musical background and the ability to play and instrument may be given preference, but anyone interested is encouraged to register.
Enrollment limit: 14.

SPEC 19 Medical Apprenticeship
Firsthand experience is a critical component of the decision to enter the health professions. Through this apprenticeship, students can clarify their understanding of the rewards
and challenges that accompany the practice of all types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on campus and are matched with a
local practitioner, while others make independent arrangements to shadow a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of medicine for
the better part of the day, five days per week. In recent years, students have shadowed physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, and public health experts.
A 5-page reflective paper is required, as is attendance (for those shadowing near campus) at three Tuesday evening programs. Students will meet from 6:30-8:30 p.m. over dinner
to hear from invited speakers from the medical community as a stimulus to discussion about their apprenticeship experiences.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend an information meeting in early October. Local enrollment is limited by the number of available practitioners. Preference for placements will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the health professions.
Cost: local apprenticeships: required vaccinations, local transportation and possibly lunches. Distant apprenticeships: costs will vary based upon location.

SPEC 20 Student Leadership Development (Same as LEAD 20)
As students move through their time in college, many will opt to take on roles of leadership in their community. This desire to be engaged and involved leads to the development
of life skills and abilities that become highly desirable traits post-graduation. Student Leadership Development is focused on assisting students in developing a new understanding of themselves, the involvement and activities they already do/plan to participate in as students and as a leaders in their groups, college, community, and world. Additionally,
this course will supply student development theories, and best practices through case study analysis and class discussion. Utilizing a series of guest speakers, film viewings,
Pecha Kucha presentations, and specified readings, participants will focus on topics including the social change model, identifying personal leadership style, ethical and servant
leadership, community building strategies, communication tactics, working with constructive feedback, personal assessment, developing purposeful programming, transferrable
skill set development and expression, professionalism, servant leadership, and finding balance. Through the duration of the course, students will engage in ongoing dialogue as a
whole class, and will also have the opportunity to create and share presentations connected to the topics of focus. Students will leave the course having an intimate awareness of
their own leadership skills, the skills of their peers, and the research and depth of development that goes along with the day-to-day interactions that culminate into their experience
as student leaders and eventually engaged citizens and community builders.
Students will be evaluated via 2 papers (total of 10 pages combined), involvement in class discussion and activities, and individual presentations.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 20.

SPEC 21 Experience the Workplace; an Internship with Williams Alumni/Parents
Field experience is a critical element in the decision to enter a profession. Through this internship, students can clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that
accompany the practice of many different aspects within a profession, and understand the psychology of the workplace. Internship placements are arranged through the Career
Center, with selected alumni and parent acting as on-site teaching associates. The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of the profession for the better part of
the day, five days per week. It is also expected that the teaching associate will assign a specific project to be completed within the three-to-four week duration of the course
depending upon appropriateness.

Participation in this winter study will require the student to quickly assess the work environment, make inferences about corporate culture, performance norms and expectations,
and to take initiative not only to learn from this experience, but also to contribute where and when appropriate. Understanding the dynamics within a work environment is critical
to success in any organization and this hands-on experience will illuminate lessons learned in the classroom. Upon completion of the winter study, it is expected that the student
write a thorough report evaluating and interpreting the experience.
Requirements: it is expected that students will complete assigned readings, keep a daily journal, and write a 5- to 10-page expository review and evaluation that will become
public record as a resource for other students.
The expectation is that each student will be in the field to observe some aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. In addition to observation there
may be an opportunity to work on distinct projects generated by the instructor depending upon appropriateness.

SPEC 24 Community Development Work and Study Project in Liberia, West Africa
Interested in a great opportunity to immerse yourself in the culture of West Africa and do some service work at the same time? This course will explore the close historical ties that
exist between Liberia, the US and even Williams - think Haystack Mounument! We’ll experience rural living in the tropical environment of the interior of Liberia as we join with
Women’s Campaign International to evaluate an ongoing leadership training program. Women’s Campaign International (WCI), in coordination with the Liberian Ministry of
Gender Development (MoGD), designed and is currently implementing a comprehensive program to increase women’s participation in peace building and decision-making
processes in Liberia. This program focuses on both the economic empowerment and political participation necessary for women to be effective leaders and bring Liberia forward
to a peaceful future. It is designed to strengthen women’s networks and build the leadership capacity of over 10,000 rural men and women in post conflict Liberia through
supporting the National Rural Women’s Program (NRWP).
Requirements: willingness to live in an environment missing many of the amenities of a ’western life style’, ability to learn interviewing skills and maintain a positive attitude
toward adapting to flexible schedules.
Prerequisites: informational/training meetings with myself and a representative from Women’s Campaign International organization; not open to first-year students.
Requirements: students will be required to keep a journal, hand in a written assignment based on their experience, and give a community presentation about their project in early
February at the start of Spring semester 2014.
Enrollment limit: 8.
Preference will be based on information meeting then a statement of interest from students and personal interviews.
Cost: $2,800 (includes round-trip air fare from New York City, visa, accommodations, in-country travel, food, pre-trip medical shots as needed).
Participants should note that, to enhance cultural learning and to stay within budget—meals will be local, not foreign tourist standard.

SPEC 26 Teaching, Doctoring and Living With Refugees and Immigrants (Same as AMST 26 and HIST 26)
Without getting on an airplane, you can have an international experience that gives you the chance to truly live and reflect upon critical issues in your Williams courses such as
national identity, migration, immigration, human rights, the state of our public schools and health care facilities, and ultimately your own identity. Sponsored by the Gaudino
Scholar and Gaudino Fund since 2008, this Winter Study course will allow a small group of students to have a relatively low-cost (compared to abroad trips) but rich and
rewarding international experience in the U.S. Portland, Maine, a refugee resettlement city for over 30 years, with only 65,000 people has over 60 languages spoken by students
in its schools, and residents from over 80 countries all over the world. Inspired by the transformative Williams-at-Home program, each student will live with a refugee or immigrant host family, and work either as a teacher or medical apprentice. Most students will work in one of the Portland school or adult education classrooms with students whose
families are new to America. The Williams student will gain practical experience as a teacher, tutor, and mentor in multiple classrooms with many diverse students. Students will
also have a chance to talk with senior teachers and administrators about the challenges facing 21st century American schools in an increasingly diverse society and global
economy. There will also be an opportunity for a student or two seeking medical or public health experience to shadow doctors and nurses in the Portland community clinics with
low income residents, including refugees who were tortured. Students will learn a great deal not only about others, but also about their own assumptions and values. In December
students will receive articles and orientation materials to prepare for their experience, and must write a 5-page reflective essay due on arrival in Maine on how forces like
ethnicity, national identity, race, and class have impacted them personally up to now. Each student must also keep a journal during the program and at the end turn in a 5-page
reflective essay addressing how her or his impressions, assumptions, or values were challenged or changed concerning those topics addressed in the opening essay. We will meet
at least 1-2 times per week to share insights and challenges, and also share a host families-students pot luck.
Prerequisites. open only to sophomores, junior and seniors. Information sessions will be held on campus approx. September 23-24.
Enrollment limit: 5 (possibly more depending on car availability).
Cost: $625 ($25/day) for room and board to host families, plus travel to and from Portland. Students on Financial Aid will receive Gaudino funding as determined by the
Financial Aid office.

SPEC 27 Snowed-in on a Vermont farm: Understanding Patterns in a Community Through Food (Same as ENVI 27)
The residency at Green Mountain Girls Farm in Northfield, Vermont emphasizes the intersection of agriculture, community, and environment. Students will stay at this small
diversified farm for one week engaging in farm life, developing a sense of place, and indentifying patterns evident on the farm and in the immediate community. Days structured
around farm chores, interpretive tours, hands-on workshops, and guest lectures will draw on pre-departure readings. The themes of these scheduled activities include permaculture design, cooking, forestry, and community development. To learn more about Green Mountain Girls Farm, visit http://eatstayfarm.com/.
Students will submit five two-page reflection papers over the course of the residency and prepare a presentation analyzing a pattern endemic to the place. Such pattern analysis
could focus on agricultural systems, food consumption practices, touristic thought, business and accounting concepts, community resiliency, or other appropriate topics. Each
student will present his or her pattern concept near the end of the residency.
Two sessions prior to departure and two sessions following the residency will offer a forum for preparation, reflection, and guidance in the production of a final written or visual
document that captures the pattern the student identifies during the residency.
Pre-departure sessions: January 6 and January 10
Dates of residency at Green Mountain Girls Farm: January 12-January 19
Post-residency sessions: January 20 and January 22
Prerequisites: none; not open to first-year students.
Requirements: Vermont is cold in January, and many activities will take place outside. Students must bring plenty of layered cold-weather clothing, including sturdy insulated
boots suitable for snowshoeing, insulated gloves, neck warmers or scarves, winter hats, and sunglasses. Some students may be asked to bring sleeping bags and sleeping pads.
Students are welcome to bring cross-country skis for recreation. Snowshoes will be provided.
Students will be evaluated on the synthesis they create in their five two-page reflection papers, the insightfulness of their pattern presentation, and their completion of the written
or visual document presenting the pattern they identify.
Enrollment limit: 9. Students that express convincing interest in the themes of the course will be preferred.

SPEC 35 Making Pottery on the Potter’s Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter’s wheel. Each student will have the use of a potter’s wheel for every class. Pottery making
classes will be held in the mornings, 9 AM to 12:15 PM, at Oak Bluffs Cottage Pottery in Pownal, Vermont. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases, and
bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects. Early
in the Winter Study Session there will be a 1.5-hour slide presentation held one afternoon at a location on Campus. After the tenth pottery making class meeting, all completed
work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh meeting will be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing, and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting, held at Oak Bluffs Cottage
Pottery early in the new Semester, will be devoted to a “final project” (positive-orientation) critique in the studio of your finished work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be
presentations on various topics relating to the science and history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites or potterymaking experience necessary, but students taking a sustaining language course will not be able to enroll in this course.
Enrollment limit: 9.
Cost: $325 lab fee, plus makeup class fees ($48 per class) if applicable.
Meeting time: mornings, plus one afternoon slide presentation, and one final 1-hour critique session early in the spring semester at a time to be arranged.

SPEC 39 “Composing A Life:” Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal
life? How will you achieve balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the “good life” for you?
We borrow the concept of “composing a life” from Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This course is
designed: (1) To offer college students an opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and professional lives before
entering the “real” world; (2) To encourage students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To provide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through “living cases” (in the form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in
contemplating their life/career options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources.
Using selected readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal
relationships in determining life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper. Weekly assignments include cases and readings from a variety of related fields,
and some self-reflection exercises. Class meets three times a week, two-hour sessions.
Prerequisites: none.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Preference to juniors and seniors.
Cost: approximately $30 for reading materials.
Meeting time: mornings.

SPEC 42 International Student Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
International students, in F1 status are allowed under US immigration law, to do any training that domestic students customarily do, with certain limited exceptions (that don’t
apply to Williams College such as flight training, English Language instruction) and within parameters set forth in regulations. The regulations for Curricular Practical Training
(CPT) allow International students to work on campus, work off-campus, engage in summer training, and otherwise do the typical things that college students do as part of their
education. The purpose of CPT is to allow international students to gain the same types of educational work experiences that domestic students are required or encouraged to
experience such as on campus and summer work. CPT is available to international students after completion of at least one full academic year at the F-1 sponsoring institution
and must be within a framework that is “an integral part of an established curriculum.” Winter Study CPT allows Williams students to meet the criteria set out by US Citizenship
and Immigration Services (USCIS) and engage in practical training work. Winter Study CPT will earn the international student academic credit. However, Winter Study CPT
will not count toward the Winter Study graduation requirement. International students participating in Winter Study CPT must take another Winter Study course to meet their
graduation requirement. The course “Winter Study CPT” does not meet the Winter Study graduation requirement.
The method of evaluation for the Winter Study CPT course for F-1 international students will be as follows: The international student will maintain a weekly journal during the
practical training experience. Using the journal entries, the international student will write a capstone paper on how it their Curricular Practical Training experience relates to their
academic major. The capstone paper must be a minimum of three (3) pages. The international student must also prepare a five (5) minute presentation which will combine oral
presentation with another media (e.g., demonstration of skills acquired, photographs of work environment, creative mixed media presentation depicting the experience).
The learning objectives for the course are;
1) Recognize and understand how US institutions work in their chosen field of study,
2) Interpret and apply personal skills and perspectives to be able to contribute to the institution or project,
3) Analyze and evaluate personal experience and critique behaviors that need to be altered to improve success for continued participation in the field of study.

NOTE:

Because no Williams student should ever have to choose between important religious, academic and athletic commitments, College policy provides for students who wish to participate in religious observances that conflict with
other obligations to make arrangements with their instructors to do so.
The policy, approved in 1984 by the faculty and trustees in compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, states that Any student who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to attend classes or to
participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such requirement, and shall be provided an opportunity to make up such requirement which s/he may have missed
because of such absence nowĊprovided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon the College. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student" who makes
use of this provision of college policy.
The faculty (including coaches) receive annual reminders of this policy, and are encouraged to work carefully with students in anticipating and resolving conflicts to their mutual satisfaction.
